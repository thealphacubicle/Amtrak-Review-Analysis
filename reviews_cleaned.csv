8,yelp.com,"Not a bad way to head to New York or Philadelphia if the price is right and if everything runs on time - both of which are big ifs. The Acela trains are generally the fastest option between Boston and New York since you don't have to wade thru traffic on both ends in getting to the airport. They're also reasonably comfortable inside, with seats that offer enough width and leg room so that you can get things done on your laptop or snooze cozily. They can be just as - if not more - expensive than flying, but you can get good deals if you can buy more than 14 days beforehand. They're not truly ""high-speed"" in a European sense, though, and the ""business class"" cabin is similar to what would be 2nd-class in Europe. The Northeast Regional trains are slower, not just because they might stop at more stations, but also because they can be deprioritized behind Acela and freight trains - so delays can cascade dramatically. Coach-class seats have better legroom than planes but are still anything but glamorous, especially if everyone around you is yakking on their phones. All this having been said, they're usually cheaper than Acela trains. Again, if everything runs on time and you can get a reasonably priced fare, Acela is definitely the way to go to New York or Philly. It still takes too long to get to DC, though, so flying is much faster and usually cheaper.","not a bad way to head to new york or philadelphia if the price is right and if everything runs on time - both of which are big ifs. the acela trains are generally the fastest option between boston and new york since you don't have to wade thru traffic on both ends in getting to the airport. they're also reasonably comfortable inside, with seats that offer enough width and leg room so that you can get things done on your laptop or snooze cozily. they can be just as - if not more - expensive than flying, but you can get good deals if you can buy more than 14 days beforehand. they're not truly ""high-speed"" in a european sense, though, and the ""business class"" cabin is similar to what would be 2nd-class in europe. the northeast regional trains are slower, not just because they might stop at more stations, but also because they can be deprioritized behind acela and freight trains - so delays can cascade dramatically. coach-class seats have better legroom than planes but are still anything but glamorous, especially if everyone around you is yakking on their phones. all this having been said, they're usually cheaper than acela trains. again, if everything runs on time and you can get a reasonably priced fare, acela is definitely the way to go to new york or philly. it still takes too long to get to dc, though, so flying is much faster and usually cheaper.","['bad', 'way', 'head', 'new', 'york', 'philadelphia', 'price', 'right', 'everything', 'runs', 'time', '-', 'big', 'ifs.', 'acela', 'trains', 'generally', 'fastest', 'option', 'boston', 'new', 'york', 'since', 'wade', 'thru', 'traffic', 'ends', 'getting', 'airport.', ""they're"", 'also', 'reasonably', 'comfortable', 'inside,', 'seats', 'offer', 'enough', 'width', 'leg', 'room', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'laptop', 'snooze', 'cozily.', '-', '-', 'expensive', 'flying,', 'get', 'good', 'deals', 'buy', '14', 'days', 'beforehand.', ""they're"", 'truly', '""high-speed""', 'european', 'sense,', 'though,', '""business', 'class""', 'cabin', 'similar', 'would', '2nd-class', 'europe.', 'northeast', 'regional', 'trains', 'slower,', 'might', 'stop', 'stations,', 'also', 'deprioritized', 'behind', 'acela', 'freight', 'trains', '-', 'delays', 'cascade', 'dramatically.', 'coach-class', 'seats', 'better', 'legroom', 'planes', 'still', 'anything', 'glamorous,', 'especially', 'everyone', 'around', 'yakking', 'phones.', 'said,', ""they're"", 'usually', 'cheaper', 'acela', 'trains.', 'again,', 'everything', 'runs', 'time', 'get', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'fare,', 'acela', 'definitely', 'way', 'go', 'new', 'york', 'philly.', 'still', 'takes', 'long', 'get', 'dc,', 'though,', 'flying', 'much', 'faster', 'usually', 'cheaper.']",0.9308,0.492923743

29,yelp.com,"It had been a couple of years since I last took an Amtrak train ride, and it seemed like the best option for me at the time, as I was making last minute travel plans while in Boston. I could not WAIT to leave my nightmare of a hotel so I just jumped online and found the next trip out of the city, purchased my ticket online, called a cab, and disappeared into the ether mid-day, even though I had already paid for my room for the night.I ended up booking a single traveler, privacy room from Boston to Washington, DC, and it was so comfy that I am secretly planning my next trip via Amtrak as I type this. I can't wait to get on the road again!Especially now, during the pandemic, it's really nice to not have anyone sitting next to you, getting up and down and generally being a distraction.

31,yelp.com,"++ Amtrak in Boston's South Station is a central location, accessible by bus, MBTA, and of course, Amtrak. You can get to anywhere you need to on the northeast US coast, and also in the city of Boston via South Station. + Amtrak provides a mobile app for ticket scanning, - decently clean seats (could be cleaner), ++ a café car, and friendly train conductors.  ++ If you've read this review up to now, your reward is now a pro cost-saving tip for anyone trying to move items cross country... AMTRAK FREIGHT SHIPPING. I shipped 306 lb of items from Boston across the country. Pricing in early 2020 is as follows: the first 1-50 lb is 85$; 51-100 lb is $95 and then additively 0.95/lb for anything 100lb+. You can't ship electronics or glass items, and no box can be over 50 lbs (they do weigh it before you pay). Payment is based on the total weight of the boxes you plan on shipping. The office hours are great, 8 AM - 7:30 PM on 7 days/week.++ Amtrak has a phone line that you can use to inquire about this service. This phone line is the only way you can get information about this service - minimal information is found on the web. The phone line folks told me my items would be palletized prior to loading onto a train. Palletization means that all your boxes get wrapped together and attached to a wooden slat and moved via forklift all at once. Decent.- The individual at South Station's Amtrak Freight Shipping office was a new kind of rude that I had not yet encountered. Keep in mind there was nobody else in line or waiting for this service. It was early morning, pretty quiet.  He informed us that my items would not be palletized, and gruffly informed to adjust the weights on our boxes as they were about 3 lb over in 1 box. The concern with not palletizing boxes in my opinion is that there is a higher chance one might separate from the rest, and might get damaged during the move. On top of that was the fact that this was simply the opposite of what we had been told about the Amtrak Freight Shipping service via phone line. Kinda bummed that Kevin was the last Bostonian I encountered before I left this storied city. Hope he's doing well tho. - There is no tracking on your items that are shipped, everything is very manual and does not seem to be very electronic - I guess this is why costs are low? Make sure you buy some insurance on your items, although nobody ever really wants to be dragged into the tedious process of getting insurance payout on damaged or lost items. Insurance is $1 per $100. ++ I dropped my stuff off late January and it arrived across country on early February in about 5 days! I had been told that a cross country move would take 4 days but up to 8-9 days due to winter and trains having to make a detour due to weather.

32,yelp.com,"Unless you have been living under a rock for the past seven years, I am sure you have figured out my love for trains. As a frequent rider of Amtrak, I had never gotten to ride the Northeast Corridor from wire to wire (Boston to Washington, DC) until just this very moment. Riding the train between both of these cities is an exhausting, yet an exhilarating adventure that I encourage everybody to do, at least once, no matter what direction. But if you do it, do it riding the Acela. It is a much faster, more manageable trip than if you ride the Northeast Regional, which is great if you plan on starting or ending your trip in New York. Anything longer might wear you down. But I went wire to wire, city to city, departing at 11:55 am and arriving into the District just before 7 pm. There is something romantic about the train that you just cannot get from flying. The beautiful Connecticut coastlines pass you by as blue as the sky, the fall foliage in the back drop just a flicker in your eye as you zoom through Rhode Island at 150 mph, crossing the iconic Hell Gate Bridge as you make a dramatic entrance into New York City, all make for an unforgettable experience. That is not including flying through New Jersey through long stretches at 135 mph in addition to the cityscapes of Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore. Crossing the Susquehanna river always brings a tear to my eye because of how gorgeous and wide it is, even if you are only riding at 90 mph, because whether it is a clear day, rainy day, or a night only illuminated by the full moon, it is always special to make that crossing, like the great explorers crossing the seas into the great unknown, you too are crossing, but for a much smaller purpose. As you can see, this is why trains are important. They do more than just get you there, they get you there in style. Not in speed or glitz and glamour, but in a romantic, 19th century emotion that makes you not want to get off, but rather get back on and make another journey.","unless you have been living under a rock for the past seven years, i am sure you have figured out my love for trains. as a frequent rider of amtrak, i had never gotten to ride the northeast corridor from wire to wire (boston to washington, dc) until just this very moment. riding the train between both of these cities is an exhausting, yet an exhilarating adventure that i encourage everybody to do, at least once, no matter what direction. but if you do it, do it riding the acela. it is a much faster, more manageable trip than if you ride the northeast regional, which is great if you plan on starting or ending your trip in new york. anything longer might wear you down. but i went wire to wire, city to city, departing at 11:55 am and arriving into the district just before 7 pm. there is something romantic about the train that you just cannot get from flying. the beautiful connecticut coastlines pass you by as blue as the sky, the fall foliage in the back drop just a flicker in your eye as you zoom through rhode island at 150 mph, crossing the iconic hell gate bridge as you make a dramatic entrance into new york city, all make for an unforgettable experience. that is not including flying through new jersey through long stretches at 135 mph in addition to the cityscapes of philadelphia, wilmington, and baltimore. crossing the susquehanna river always brings a tear to my eye because of how gorgeous and wide it is, even if you are only riding at 90 mph, because whether it is a clear day, rainy day, or a night only illuminated by the full moon, it is always special to make that crossing, like the great explorers crossing the seas into the great unknown, you too are crossing, but for a much smaller purpose. as you can see, this is why trains are important. they do more than just get you there, they get you there in style. not in speed or glitz and glamour, but in a romantic, 19th century emotion that makes you not want to get off, but rather get back on and make another journey.","['unless', 'living', 'rock', 'past', 'seven', 'years,', 'sure', 'figured', 'love', 'trains.', 'frequent', 'rider', 'amtrak,', 'never', 'gotten', 'ride', 'northeast', 'corridor', 'wire', 'wire', '(boston', 'washington,', 'dc)', 'moment.', 'riding', 'train', 'cities', 'exhausting,', 'yet', 'exhilarating', 'adventure', 'encourage', 'everybody', 'do,', 'least', 'once,', 'matter', 'direction.', 'it,', 'riding', 'acela.', 'much', 'faster,', 'manageable', 'trip', 'ride', 'northeast', 'regional,', 'great', 'plan', 'starting', 'ending', 'trip', 'new', 'york.', 'anything', 'longer', 'might', 'wear', 'down.', 'went', 'wire', 'wire,', 'city', 'city,', 'departing', '11:55', 'arriving', 'district', '7', 'pm.', 'something', 'romantic', 'train', 'cannot', 'get', 'flying.', 'beautiful', 'connecticut', 'coastlines', 'pass', 'blue', 'sky,', 'fall', 'foliage', 'back', 'drop', 'flicker', 'eye', 'zoom', 'rhode', 'island', '150', 'mph,', 'crossing', 'iconic', 'hell', 'gate', 'bridge', 'make', 'dramatic', 'entrance', 'new', 'york', 'city,', 'make', 'unforgettable', 'experience.', 'including', 'flying', 'new', 'jersey', 'long', 'stretches', '135', 'mph', 'addition', 'cityscapes', 'philadelphia,', 'wilmington,', 'baltimore.', 'crossing', 'susquehanna', 'river', 'always', 'brings', 'tear', 'eye', 'gorgeous', 'wide', 'is,', 'even', 'riding', '90', 'mph,', 'whether', 'clear', 'day,', 'rainy', 'day,', 'night', 'illuminated', 'full', 'moon,', 'always', 'special', 'make', 'crossing,', 'like', 'great', 'explorers', 'crossing', 'seas', 'great', 'unknown,', 'crossing,', 'much', 'smaller', 'purpose.', 'see,', 'trains', 'important.', 'get', 'there,', 'get', 'style.', 'speed', 'glitz', 'glamour,', 'romantic,', '19th', 'century', 'emotion', 'makes', 'want', 'get', 'off,', 'rather', 'get', 'back', 'make', 'another', 'journey.']",0.9935,0.534517335

49,yelp.com,"I looked forward to a relaxing day aboard a train from Boston's Back Bay station to Albany, New York and then a sleeping car to Cleveland, Ohio after a long but productive week visiting clients. I was not disappointed.I booked the Amtrak tickets online. Their website is kind of clunky and the information about the amenities aboard the trains limited. An upgrade is in order. A handful of short videos that shows riders what to expect would go a long, long way to improving the experience.Train 449 from Boston to Albany was superb. A few passengers continuing via sleeper car were pulled aside and seated in what seemed to be a business class car near the front of the train. Maybe that was included in the price of the ticket but, if so, that wasn't obvious to me when I purchased the ticket and it wasn't indicated on the printout of the ticket.Seating was incredibly comfortable. Tons of leg room -- far more than you get when flying first class -- and plugs and free wifi throughout the train. Being able to stand, walk around, and visit with friends make for a pleasurable, stress free experience. The conductors were friendly and clearly had a passion for rail.Upon arrival in Albany we moved into the nice, clean station for maybe 30 minutes while the train was reconfigured. I heard that the train from Boston is literally merged with the train from New York and the combined train then continues west to Chicago with stops in a handful of cities including my destination of Cleveland.The sleeper car was great as was the sleeper car attendant, Alfred. He was friendly, eager to please, and seemed to really enjoy making the travel experience a pleasure for the riders. The cabins was roughly four feet wide, eight feet long, and 10 feet high. There were two seats, a sink, and a toilet. The seats converted into a single bed and a second single bed lowered from the ceiling with the end result being like a bunk bed. Alfred did a nice job of showing me the various amenities and talking through what I could expect after I boarded and then converted my seats into the bed when I was ready.Dinner in the dining car was included. There were roughly 10 tables with each setup for four passengers. No reservations were necessary. You just showed up, were seated, ordered, and your cooked-to-order meal then served. I was traveling alone and so could have been seated with others if there wasn't room but I ended up alone at the table. That was fine with me as I was in the midst of watching a movie on my laptop. There were some other tables were strangers shared a table and every single one of them seemed to enjoy the experience. Lots of laughter and friendships made.I wouldn't hesitate to repeat the experience. It was fun, relaxing, and a great experience.","i looked forward to a relaxing day aboard a train from boston's back bay station to albany, new york and then a sleeping car to cleveland, ohio after a

53,yelp.com,"I was boarding my train from PVD to BOS, Acela Express number 2164, Dec. 20th. 2019. During my boarding at PVD station I received racist profiling and profiling based on race by a black male first class conductor. I was trying to board the train, and held my iPhone on my hand showing the ticket in Apple Wallet. I showed the ticket to his face and showed my intention for boarding the first class train. However, despite the ticket in his face, he first asked me ""first class?"" and even after I pushed the ticket right in front of his face, he insisted ""are you first class on Acela 2164?"" I answered yes and let myself in. After I was seated, I heard him asking the other white male conductor to double check my ticket. When I showed my ticket in front of his face for a solid 5+ seconds. If he couldn't read then I don't think he should qualify for this job as a FIRST CLASS conductor. He should be considered a safety hazard due to his inability to respect guests, refrain from racism/profiling, and read train tickets. Afterwards the actual ticket inspector came alone and respectfully examined my tickets, which is the 3rd time I showed my tickets to board this damn train.It would be one thing if I was dressed like a bum and trying to board the train, but even in such a case after I showed him my ticket I should be allowed to board without triple checking my tickets. And I was wearing a $300 custom made leather shoes, $700 Canada Goose jacket, $300 Bose headphone, $400 Tumi bag, and $1000 Rimowa carry-on case. I was dressed very respectful, and he still doubted that I paid for my seat on this train. Which lead me to my conclusion that it could only be a racist act since I am asian and looked young. I am not aware of any regulations stating 20ish people are forbidden from riding first class on Amtrak. I am a Platinum Medallion with Delta airlines, and I fly 50+ times and spends 15k+ on flights each year. No once any airline employee doubted my right to priority boarding or seating in first class after I show them my ticket/membership card.

I did this knowing I may need to cancel my friends ticket and felt better knowing I was covered and took the appropriate action. I called to cancel the ticket and was told that there would be a cancellation fee. I said I purchased insurance and that fee shouldn't apply. That is when I was told the insurance what outsourced. I said that was not made clear and I just wanted my ticket refunded. She said she couldn't help me and transferred me. I then spoke to a man that said no I would be reinbursed fully and he would facilitate the whole process, and then he promptly hung up on me and I ended up with another person and I had no idea who it was and they had no idea what was going on. I had to re-explain the whole story and was told they were insurance, and would not refund me, and that my insurance was not one that covered cancellation for miscellaneous. I then called Amtrak back, rexplained the whole thing and asked for a manager. I was told okay and transferred again. I again was with ANOTHER agent that I had to re-explain AGAIN the whole story and was told I could not speak to a manager and could not be refunded. May I also say the entire time all of this happened, every single agent was rude, aggressive, and condescending. At this point I was so frustrated and upset that I was crying. I told her that I had been put through the ringer, misinformed multiple times, the purchasing of the insurance and it's nuanced policies and outsourced nature was not made clear when I PURCHASED IT THROUGH AMTRAK. I said that I just wanted the 20 dollar cancel fee waved due to the lack of clarity in insurance policy and the horrible customer service. She transferred me to customer service. There I AGAIN explained it all, listened to the same cycle of rude, condescending banter. I made it clear what I wanted and why I felt it was warranted to have my fee waved.  The customer service agent then said ""I won't refund you because someone was rude"" in a mocking tone which tells me that she missed everything I told her about what I've been through or how I felt, and I felt it was an extremely inappropriate response for a customer service agent to provide. At this point I had spoken to 6 people, spent an hour, and needed to leave to go to my grandfathers funeral  and I freaked out and hung up. I am at a loss right now. This totally sent me over the edge and it was jarring to go through 6 people that could have helped me, yet refused to- OVER 20 DOLLARS ON THEIR END. Ultimately, this process cost me 40 dollars- 20 dollar cancellation fee and the 18 dollars I spend on insurance that wasn't even effective for what I wanted. I tried to do the right thing- I paid extra for insurance, I spoke to multiple agents and the insurance company, I made it clear exactly what I was seeking and why, and was met with derision, insult, and poor service. This is all over a train ticket. I wanted the 20 dollars back for my train ticket cancel fee, but apparently failure on the companies part to fully inform and serve customers is irrelevant. I hope you guys enjoyed that hour of my life,  my 40 dollars, and listening to me cry.

119,yelp.com,"This review will be both for the Acela Express First Class; since I am not sure where to yelp this. As a release I have actually never taken Amtrak Business Class or Standard Seat non Acela train.Environment:I have mixed feeling about the First Class on Acela when compared to flying. The main reason is because the train tends to vibrate and the your plate and utensils while slide back on the tray. The vibration gets really really annoying especially when trying to enjoy a wine and your glass is moving across the table. The train is very quite though and QC15 clear any remaining ambiance. The seats are very comfortable and wide. They are upholstered in blue leather and have good recline. The leather is in good condition and the windows are large. AC adapters are present which is excellent. On a plus side the First Class car was pretty much empty. The over heads also have ample room to fit a Tumi Alpha Continental Carry On or even larger. It does not seem as if Amtrak is policing the hand luggage policy. The bathroom is large and well lit, but really needs to be inspected and cleaned more often. Not to be picky but the first class bathroom shouldn't have used towels on the counters and the trash overflowing.*Also not a problem on my ride since the carriage was pretty much empty, but the original seat I decided to sit in had coffee spill marks and crumbs all over the carpet. Amtrak should take a bit more time tidying the train after each run. This could have caused some issues if the train was full.Food:The food was good and very similiar when compared to United's trans con flights in United First. The best part was getting a proper sized wine glass not one of dinky tiny sample glass when you fly. I was pretty full so order some light cheese and crackers. The crackers were packaged and the cheese was served at an appropriate temperature and had a good texture and color. As mentioned the tray tends to run across the table because of the trains vibration. A possible solution could be using a dinning table cloth as the airlines provide. It was nice to receive proper metal utensils and quality dinning linen. Service:5 of 5 for service. The cabin attendant was excellent. She personally introduced herself to each passenger which was about 5 and took our orders. Routinely made rounds and refiled the wine. Amtrak is not stingy at all in this area. I think by the time ended I was clearly buzzed. Thank goodness I was taking a cab at my destination. The happy cheer personality and service attitude seemed truly genuine throughout the journeyOther:As a whole I was pretty happy, but for the price paid I might consider Acela Business Class on my next trip.","this review will be both for the acela express first class; since i am not sure where to yelp this. as a release i have actually never taken amtrak business class or standard seat non acela

120,yelp.com,"I love Amtrak! It's the most comfortable way to travel. I've taken the Acela and the Northeast Regional coach seats numerous times,  as well as the Vermonter (8 hours, NY to VT, both coach and business class) twice.The Amtrak ride is pretty smooth, with little traffic, and the trains don't have that stinky bus smell like, well, a bus. Plus, a good portion of the NY-Boston trip is next to the water, so you get a pretty view, too. The Vermonter travels mostly through the woods, which is also pretty to look at, until it gets dark out. Then the impressive darkness is only punctuated by a few cute towns and the light from houses.My favorite part about taking Amtrak is the AC plugs. I can plug in my laptop and watch movies. It's not 4 hours to NY...it's 4 episodes of ""Grey's Anatomy.""  The seats are roomy and comfortable, although in coach you can start feeling stiff after a few hours, though if the train's not crowded they let you lie down on two seats. Plus, the staff is always nice and the bathrooms are as clean as a moving bathroom will get. You can get snacks at the Cafe Car, but they are really expensive so I don't bother.  Their luggage policy is reasonably lenient, so you can bring a 2 suitcases plus a backpack and a laptop case. And if that second suitcase happens to be the laundry bag from your dorm room, Amtrak doesn't usually mind.The Acela train is definitely nicer than the regular cars they use, but it's not always worth the extra money. Beware of high-volume days when they rotate in the old coaches with the red seats-they're less comfortable and don't always have AC plugs. Also beware of the Quiet Car if you plan on making any noise whatsoever, since it's supposed to be ""library quiet"" and some passengers interpret that as ""morgue quiet.""  The Quiet Car varies from train to train (it's usually an end car though) so pay attention when the conductor announces where it is.Amtrak customer service is usually good about making ticket adjustments if you need to cancel or change your trip.

135,yelp.com,"I went to Virginia this summer to pick up my niece for a visit. Amtrak does not possess long distance fast trains like other industrialized areas of the world. They were surprised to hear that anyone could cover that distance in less than 13 hours. As a point of reference, the approximate 600 miles between Boston and Virginia takes 13 hours, or about 46 mph. The approximate 550 miles between Paris and Berlin takes 8 hours, or about 68 mph. A similar distance in Japan is as fast as the European trek. Spent a cold, uncomfortable night (in August... the A/C was blasting) without a footrest, which would have made all the difference in the world, woke up to decent coffee, but a horrible breakfast otherwise: full of high fructose corn syrup... who the heck needs that for yogurt and granola? But that was the best thing they offered, so that gives you an idea. The trains are not quiet at all and they made no effort to keep a noisy car and a quiet car, so your standard group of boorish jerks sat at one end of my car shouting at each other for several hours in what they apparently considered witty and erudite conversation between about midnight and 3am. The platforms at Back Bay Station are so poorly marked that I actually boarded a commuter train before realizing my mistake (and really, that of the conductor who looked at my Amtrak tickets and told me to get on the train). We had a forty minute stop in DC that they did not announce or explain. Some people apparently knew enough to get up, get off the train and get some semi-real food. I wish I had. The ride back with a 10 year old was a little bit better because at least I knew what to expect, so we had a blanket with us. I still needed a footrest. Seriously, a little pulldown bar would have really and truly made a huge difference. I felt bad for the group of college students who had no idea about the A/C who then spent time trying to make spare t-shirts into blankets. It's cheaper to take the train than to fly or drive. It's not as cheap as it is in other countries with faster trains, oddly enough. If I'd slept in my car I could've made it possibly cheaper to drive, but ... did I really want to spend 4 days driving up and down the eastern seaboard, 2 of those with a 10 year old? I thought about it, and decided the slowest train in the industrialized world was probably the best option. On the way back I refused to get off at Back Bay and went right into South Station, where I had to go anyway for the commuter rail back out to Worcester. It doesn't really matter which one you board/disembark at, apparently, so I would recommend South Station any day over the other.","i went to virginia this summer to pick up my niece for a visit. amtrak does not possess long distance fast trains like other industrialized areas of the world. they were surprised to hear that anyone could cover that distance in less than 13 hours. as a point of reference, the approximate 600 miles between boston and virginia takes 13 hours, or about 46 mph. the approximate 550 miles between paris and berlin takes 8 hours, or about 68 mph. a similar distance in japan is as fast as the european trek. spent a cold, uncomfortable night (in august... the a/c was blasting) without a footrest, which would have made all the difference in the world, woke up to decent coffee, but a horrible breakfast otherwise: full of high fructose corn syrup... who the heck needs that for yogurt and granola?

Before 1997 my trips on Amtrak were far fewer but since my sister moved to NYC back then I've become a more frequent rider. I've taken other forms of transportation to Manhattan and points south but I'd recommend Amtrak over the rest.Good stuff? Ticketing and booking reservations is easy, as is changing a reservation. Employees at the stations and aboard the trains are friendly, knowledgable, and take pride in serving the public. That counts for a lot. Aboard the train there's room to use one's laptop, sleep without becoming too cramped, and a cafe car to get a snack, sandwich, or cocktail. When the train is moving the ride is relatively comfortable and passengers aren't tossed around. And the view...on the way down the Connecticut shoreline is so close you could touch it.That said, there are a few things that take away from what could be an almost perfect travelling experience. The on-time performance of Amtrak trains in the Northeast isn't great. I have dealt with delays of between 20 minutes and 2 hours a number of times in the past couple of years and I hope they'll cease. The train schedule is adequate but would be vastly improved by the addition of a couple of more trips, especially one that would leave Boston earlier on weekday mornings.

160,yelp.com,"Just finished a trip from Boston south station with a connection in Chicago to San Francisco. If I had to do it again, I would fly to Chicago and do the 2 nights to California from there. Let me first say the sleeper on the Boston to Chicago leg was actually a few inches bigger than the Chicago train. That being said there were a couple of things that were terrible about the Boston leg....1- the sleeper car was RIGHT BEHIND the locomotive car! Not so good. They literally blew the horn every few minutes ALL NIGHT LONG. 2- there was no proper mining car on the Boston leg. Which meant all meals were literally microwaved. Yeah. Which had this been a camp ground or a hostile I wouldn't care. But for what we paid.... Onto the good. And there was a lot good, cool, fascinating about it. Our car attendants (both legs) were excellent! Turn down service, answer questions, explaining things about trains etc. sense of humor. We asked for extra pillows and viola! Pillows. I would suggest that if you like air flow; bring a personal fan. There is outlets in each room. They cannot possibly please everybody on the car with temps. And both my husband and I run HOT. We have a fan going all winter (and we live in NE). The first leg each room had a toilet. Which was great for my 2x pee in the middle of the night. The views were pretty cool. People were rather friendly. The observation lounge was nice. There was a cafe underneath it for light snacks & beverages of all types. It was rather relaxing. Meals were pretty good for a train. They were cooked to order. Dinners are done by reservations. Or you could have your room attendant bring dinner to your room. We did that 50% of the time. Plan on always being seated with other travelers. If there are 2 in your party you will be seated with another party of 2. If there are 3 they will stick a single person with you etc. they have limited seating. It is what it is. I'm very outgoing and it wasn't my favorite part. However, we did meet some fascinating people. Which gave us some interesting conversations. My husband is much more shy then me; so we opted for 50% of meals in dinner car. Dessert comes with every meal. Except breakfast. Each car attendant brews fresh coffee each morning for their car. Which was great! Bathrooms were kept shockingLY clean for a train. All in all, great experience. Would highly recommend.","just finished a trip from boston south station with a connection in chicago to san francisco. if i had to do it again, i would fly to chicago and do the 2 nights to california from there. let me first say the sleeper on the boston to chicago leg was actually a few inches bigger than the chicago train. that being said there were a couple of things that were terrible about the boston leg....1- the sleeper car was right behind the locomotive car! not so good. they literally blew the horn every few minutes all night long. 2- there was no proper mining car on the boston leg. which meant all meals were literally microwaved. yeah. which had this been a camp ground or a hostile i wouldn't care. but for what we paid.... onto the good. and there was a lot good, cool, fascinating about it. our car attendants (both legs) were excellent! turn down service, answer questions, explaining things about trains etc. sense of humor. we asked for extra pillows and viola! pillows. i would suggest that if you like air flow; bring a personal fan. there is outlets in each room. they cannot possibly please everybody on the car with temps. and both my husband and i run hot. we have a fan going all winter (and we live in ne). the first leg each room had a toilet. which was great for my 2x pee in the middle of the night. the views were pretty cool. people were rather friendly. the observation lounge was nice. there was a cafe underneath it for light snacks & beverages of all types. it was rather relaxing. meals were pretty good for a train. they were cooked to order. dinners are done by reservations. or you could have your room attendant bring dinner to your room. we did that 50% of the time. plan on always being seated with other travelers. if there are 2 in your party you will be seated with another party of 2. if there are 3 they will stick a single person with you etc. they have limited seating. it is what it is. i'm very outgoing and it wasn't my favorite part. however, we did meet some fascinating people. which gave us some interesting conversations. my husband is much more shy then me; so we opted for 50% of meals in dinner car. dessert comes with every meal. except breakfast. each car attendant brews fresh coffee each morning for their car. which was great! bathrooms were kept shockingly clean for a train. all in all, great experience. would highly recommend.","['finished', 'trip', 'boston', 'south', 'station', 'connection', 'chicago', 'san', 'francisco.', 'again,', 'would', 'fly', 'chicago', '2', 'nights', 'california', 'there.', 'let', 'first', 'say', 'sleeper', 'boston', 'chicago', 'leg', 'actually', 'inches', 'bigger', 'chicago', 'train.', 'said', 'couple', 'things', 'terrible', 'boston', 'leg....1-', 'sleeper', 'car', 'right', 'behind', 'locomotive', 'car!', 'good.', 'literally', 'blew', 'horn', 'every', 'minutes', 'night', 'long.', '2-', 'proper', 'mining', 'car', 'boston', 'leg.', 'meant', 'meals', 'literally', 'microwaved.', 'yeah.', 'camp', 'ground', 'hostile', 'care.', 'paid....', 'onto', 'good.', 'lot', 'good,', 'cool,', 'fascinating', 'it.', 'car', 'attendants', '(both', 'legs)', 'excellent!', 'turn', 'service,', 'answer', 'questions,', 'explaining', 'things', 'trains', 'etc.', 'sense', 'humor.', 'asked', 'extra', 'pillows', 'viola!', 'pillows.', 'would', 'suggest', 'like', 'air', 'flow;', 'bring', 'personal', 'fan.', 'outlets', 'room.', 'cannot', 'possibly', 'please', 'everybody', 'car', 'temps.', 'husband', 'run', 'hot.', 'fan', 'going', 'winter', '(and', 'live', 'ne).', 'first', 'leg', 'room', 'toilet.', 'great', '2x', 'pee', 'middle', 'night.', 'views', 'pretty', 'cool.', 'people', 'rather', 'friendly.', 'observation', 'lounge', 'nice.', 'cafe', 'underneath', 'light', 'snacks', '&', 'beverages', 'types.', 'rather', 'relaxing.', 'meals', 'pretty', 'good', 'train.', 'cooked', 'order.', 'dinners', 'done', 'reservations.', 'could', 'room', 'attendant', 'bring', 'dinner', 'room.', '50%', 'time.', 'plan', 'always', 'seated', 'travelers.', '2', 'party', 'seated', 'another', 'party', '2.', '3', 'stick', 'single', 'person', 'etc.', 'limited', 'seating.', 'is.', ""i'm"", 'outgoing', 'favorite', 'part.', 'however,', 'meet', 'fascinating', 'people.', 'gave', 'us', 'interesting', 'conversations.', 'husband', 'much', 'shy', 'me;', 'opted', '50%', 'meals', 'dinner', 'car.', 'dessert', 'comes', 'every', 'meal.', 'except', 'breakfast.', 'car', 'attendant', 'brews', 'fresh', 'coffee', 'morning', 'car.', 'great!', 'bathrooms', 'kept', 'shockingly', 'clean', 'train.', 'all,', 'great', 'experience.', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend.']",0.9984,0.550273729

177,yelp.com,"This was my first experience taking the Acela Express from Boston to NYC. I've had no problems with the shuttles from Logan, but this time I needed to end up right in Times Square so I figured it was worth a shot. All seats are ""business class"", but I think once everyone becomes ""special"" it's pretty clear that nobody is. The seats are fairly spacious and comfy, but I'm not sure what is ""business class"" about them. I guess they aren't the plastic benches on the T buses. There is also constant minor turbulence from the track, but really this should be expected. Finally, aside from cruising pretty fast from Boston to Providence this train has not been very ""express"", particularly on some really slow stretches through CT. The food is atrocious.

I prefer the car as I can get door-to-door in 3 hours for the price of an Indian lunch buffet, but since my car was murdered by an enormous pine tree a few weeks ago, I have had to resort to public transportation.Being a cheap college senior in a recession, I generally opt for the $15 Bolt bus which features electrical outlets and wifi, but the speed, accessibility, and comfort of Amtrak, particularly its Acela line, are too great to overlook. For half the price of a plane ticket, I can sit back, relax, and occasionally get some work done.Amtrak has made some improvements in the past few months, too. For one, they have decreased  their one-way ticket prices by about 25% (from about $93 to $79 depending on how early you book). Secondly, they have a generous Amtrak Rewards program for frequent travelers (e.g. I received a free round-trip ticket from Boston to New York after only three trips).

I went back redid the process and again the same thing. I restarted my phone and then tried to book on another device! Again, the same exact thing happened. I took screenshots of the fare being displayed and what happens at checkout and then contacted Amtrak for assistance. I was met with the most insensitive, disgusting and extremely rude rep I have ever encountered. He wouldn’t even allow me to explain the situation after being on hold for an entire hour! He then hung up on me without hearing what issues I was experiencing and without helping me at all. I was forced to call back and have been currently on hold for an hour and 15 minutes and counting! Truly sad and disgusting the way that they treat their customers. To act rude and disgusting towards someone that is grieving is unacceptable! True, he may not have know my situation but why should a customer SERVICE agent need to know a person’s personal circumstances in order to show decency and kindness or to provide the necessary support that your customers need?? Truly disappointed!! Although on my end it’s still displaying the cheaper fare, I was told that Amtrak will not honor what I’m seeing as it only matters what they can see.

340,trustpilot.com,"Horrible experience today. I had purchased a round trip from BWI to Newark and paid a premium as I guess it is Spring break. They did not scan my ticket on the way up. I didn’t think anything of it- the conductor just seemed busy and disorganized. When I got in my seat for the return trip, someone else said it was their seat and their ticket showed the same seat as me. When the conductor scanned it, he said mine was cancelled as there was no record of me doing the first leg of the trip. The return ticket was still showing in my app, no one contacted me to ask if I had done the first leg or even to tell me they had cancelled the return ticket (who just arbitrarily cancels a ticket someone has paid for) so I had no idea before getting on the train. When I explained the situation to the conductor and said it was cancelled in error- he got annoyed at me and said rudely  - “you need to move as you are in HIS seat” referring to the other passenger. I actually had to tell him to remain nice as this was not my fault and I am being moved from MY seat due to their error.

352,trustpilot.com,"I am a very disappointed and dissatisfied customer. I ride Amtrak twice a week, every week. There are several times when the train is late, and I miss my ride to my destination and many times miss my connecting train, to my destination. Today I was 2 late because there was an accident on Route 66 in VA which is my route to catch Silver line, which is my first train to union station in Washington DC. Unfortunately I had to arrive at union Station in Washington DC 2 minutes to my train departure time. My was 138 and departure time was 6:05, I arrived 6:03 and was told I can’t go because the doors are closed. I was referred to the ticket department, met the first customer service woman, who told me I will have to pay a huge amount for the difference with the next train. I asked if there is anything she can do, she asked me to wait for the supervisor. She clearly told me with a tight voice that she cannot do anything for me. Now I have been charged an additional fee of $108.00 with no remorse from the supervisor.  she told me there nothing she can do and I will have to pay $108.00 for a later train or refund my money. I cannot believe what she said, I think she thinks I am just riding the train for fun. I told her I can’t cancel my trip because I have to be at work. Even when I told her I am a frequent rider and there had been times when the train is late and ended up missing my connecting train or ride, all she said was, I should have called for compensation which, just like not knowing that the doors closed 2 minutes to departure time, I don’t know I should call any time my train is delayed. I called customer relations and stayed on the phone for over an hour. I had to hang up and write this review. This is very heart rendering. The customer service is too poor. They act like they are God, they posses too much power and talk to customer in a very rude manner. I am writing for customer relations to look into my issue and refund me the $108.00 that I have been charged. I hope this issue would be looked at seriously. Thank you","i am a very disappointed and dissatisfied customer. i ride amtrak twice a week, every week. there are several times when the train is late, and i miss my ride to my destination and many times miss my connecting train, to my destination. today i was 2 late because there was an accident on route 66 in va which is my route to catch silver line, which is my first train to union station in washington dc. unfortunately i had to arrive at union station in washington dc 2 minutes to my train departure time. my was 138 and departure time was 6:05, i arrived 6:03 and was told i can’t go because the doors are closed. i was referred to the ticket department, met the first customer service woman, who told me i will have to pay a huge amount for the difference with the next train. i asked if there is anything she can do, she asked me to wait for the supervisor. she clearly told me with a tight voice that she cannot do anything for me. now i have been charged an additional fee of $108.00 with no remorse from the supervisor.  she told me there nothing she can do and i will have to pay $108.00 for a later train or refund my money. i cannot believe what she said, i think she thinks i am just riding the train for fun. i told her i can’t cancel my trip because i have to be at work. even when i told her i am a frequent rider and there had been times when the train is late and ended up missing my connecting train or ride, all she said was, i should have called for compensation which, just like not knowing that the doors closed 2 minutes to departure time, i don’t know i should call any time my train is delayed. i called customer relations and stayed on the phone for over an hour. i had to hang up and write this review. this is very heart rendering. the customer service is too poor. they act like they are god, they posses too much power and talk to customer in a very rude manner. i am writing for customer relations to look into my issue and refund me the $108.00 that i have been charged. i hope this issue would be looked at seriously. thank you","['disappointed', 'dissatisfied', 'customer.', 'ride', 'amtrak', 'twice', 'week,', 'every', 'week.', 'several', 'times', 'train', 'late,', 'miss', 'ride', 'destination', 'many', 'times', 'miss', 'connecting', 'train,', 'destination.', 'today', '2', 'late', 'accident', 'route', '66', 'va', 'route', 'catch', 'silver', 'line,', 'first', 'train', 'union', 'station', 'washington', 'dc.', 'unfortunately', 'arrive', 'union', 'station', 'washington', 'dc', '2', 'minutes', 'train', 'departure', 'time.', '138', 'departure', 'time', '6:05,', 'arrived', '6:03', 'told', 'can’t', 'go', 'doors', 'closed.', 'referred', 'ticket', 'department,', 'met', 'first', 'customer', 'service', 'woman,', 'told', 'pay', 'huge', 'amount', 'difference', 'next', 'train.', 'asked', 'anything', 'do,', 'asked', 'wait', 'supervisor.', 'clearly', 'told', 'tight', 'voice', 'cannot', 'anything', 'me.', 'charged', 'additional', 'fee', '$108.00', 'remorse', 'supervisor.', 'told', 'nothing', 'pay', '$108.00', 'later', 'train', 'refund', 'money.', 'cannot', 'believe', 'said,', 'think', 'thinks', 'riding', 'train', 'fun.', 'told', 'can’t', 'cancel', 'trip', 'work.', 'even', 'told', 'frequent', 'rider', 'times', 'train', 'late', 'ended', 'missing', 'connecting', 'train', 'ride,', 'said', 'was,', 'called', 'compensation', 'which,', 'like', 'knowing', 'doors', 'closed', '2', 'minutes', 'departure', 'time,', 'don’t', 'know', 'call', 'time', 'train', 'delayed.', 'called', 'customer', 'relations', 'stayed', 'phone', 'hour.', 'hang', 'write', 'review.', 'heart', 'rendering.', 'customer', 'service', 'poor.', 'act', 'like', 'god,', 'posses', 'much', 'power', 'talk', 'customer', 'rude', 'manner.', 'writing', 'customer', 'relations', 'look', 'issue', 'refund', '$108.00', 'charged.', 'hope', 'issue', 'would', 'looked', 'seriously.', 'thank']",-0.5335,0.408640873

360,trustpilot.com,"I decided it would be a good idea to travel via Amtrak from  Hattiesburg, Mississippi to Union Station/Washington, DC and then home to Maryland. The beginning part of the trip was saddened by the death of my eldest sister's husband, us going home to Mississippi Gulf Coast for his funeral.  We had already shipped his body, and wanted to just be around my eldest sister and each other. My son and another sister decided to do the same.  For my son, it would be his first memory of riding in a train. They each received different messages from Amtrak and missed their train.   So they did not travel until Thursday, April 20th.  Their trip was delayed by 4 hours and their experience was so horrible that my son — said, no thanks back to flying. ONE and DONE! The rudeness of the employees was horrible under the circumstances. (Unfortunately, a teenage kid tried to beat the train. My condolences to his family.) My son was on the phone with me and I could hear someone being SO RUDE, I was shocked to learn it was an Amtrak employee speaking like that. She was VERY nasty to the riders, At least she was non discriminatory, as she raised her voice at all of them.  I shocked by what I was over hearing.  I wished I had thought to record her too. Next day, I was enroute and got caught by a CSX train. When I called Amtrak I was informed they were behind schedule, NOT TRUE. I missed my  train on Friday, April 21st. (Unfortunately , I had already turned my rental car in, I was lucky they dropped me off at the train station.) On Saturday, April 22nd, I arrived early and waited for the train. It was my first time paying to ride in the sleeper cars/a Roomette.  I tried to ask the Amtrak employee who came off the train and was standing by the door/gate where I should stand, WOW!(I was trying to ask where should I go for the sleeping cars…get in her line or do I go somewhere else.) The VERY RUDE employee threw her hand up at me, in the motion of shut up, and I did. The hand motion was clear to me and others that I was to shut up, so I did).  (I had two witnesses, the relative and new friend helping me with my luggage.) Well, after saying all aboard, I was like wait!!! The Rude Amtrak employee said she did not know I needed to ask a question or that I was riding the train.  It was a customer that told me where to go to board the sleeper car. Unfortunately, the same RUDE employee, appeared at the sleeper car.  She said I was not listed as a passenger on the train, and therefore I could not board .  No matter what I said, she held firm.I was pretty much begging her to check and insisting that I was on that train.  I checked my email, didn’t see the update but I was verbally inform by an Amtrak employee that my train would have the information.  The RUDE employee told me that I could not ride and pulled up the steps. I just felt so overwhelmed from my BIL's death, missing the train and then not getting on the train. If not for my cousin, I know I would have broken down. On Sunday, April 23, 2023, I was back at the station a 3rd time.  The conductor informed me that my name is very familiar.  I told her you may have seen it listed, since this is my 3rd attempt to ride this train home.I decided to contact Amtrak CS, and file a complaint when I arrived home.  Guess What!  CS also saw my name listed for each day that I was supposed to be on the train.  Both CS and the Conductor referenced my being on the train on Saturday, 22 April.  BTW:  My train was also late arriving into Union Station, we were delayed. On top of everything else. SMH.I waited, but never heard from Amtrak. I filed a complaint with the BBB, again no response.

366,trustpilot.com,"We planned an Amtrak vacation over a year in advance for a once in a lifetime experience to travel from Houston up through Chicago and to Boston to see the fall leaves changing colors. I have wanted to do this most of my adult life. My husband set up my first train ride ever to celebrate my birthday, and for what we hoped would be a truly memorable experience. It was, but for all the wrong reasons. We worked with Amtrak vacation planners and spent a fortune for what was sold to us as a first class experiences on Amtrak's sleeper bedrooms with dining cars and a chef to serve us in our bedroom or in the dining car. First thing, we spent 4 hours on a gross, cramped, dirty bus from Houston to Longview to get on the #22 train to Chicago. Then we spent 4.5 hours waiting on hard benches while the train was late. The Amtrak person actually said ""it's late and sometimes they don't even show up, so be prepared."" The service and food on Amtrak were horrid. We wandered around trying to find food every mealtime and the employees were all sitting on their phones yacking with each other. They acted like we didn't exist. Nobody pays any attention to the customers, and if they do, it's like you're an inconvenience. The ""first class"" food is boxed, unrecognizable grossness that has been microwaved to the point that you can't even get it off the plastic plate with the plastic knife. Even airline food is significantly better than the garbage they serve on Amtrak. We both rated it F-; it was that bad, and I mean every meal. The only thing worth asking for is something like yogurt or a soda in a can, which will be warm. Our bedroom #D was disgustingly unclean. There were leftover water bottles and pills on the floor from a previous guest. One bath towel was even covered with mold. The saving grace is the timing of the scenery and catching the fall leaves turning colors. That part is glorious. Sadly, the windows on every bit of the train and all the cars are so dirty that it's hard to see the scenery details through them. I'm writing this after the first segment Houston to Chicago, and so far can't recommend Amtrak to my worst enemy, much less someone I care about.

372,trustpilot.com,"This winter my husband and I decided to visit my family for Christmas. We live in Oregon and they live in Montana. Going into the winter season we knew it would not be safe to drive for the visit because of the mountain passes between here and our destination. At first, we looked at plane tickets and were quickly overwhelmed buy the prices and travel times. We decided to try something different and take the train. At first, all seemed well. We arranged to take the train from Pasco, WA to Whitefish, MT and my father would drive 3 hours to pick us up. Everything was in order.To spare everyone the long story of our travel experience, here are some numbers: 2 cancellations, 13 hours of delays for a distance that can be traveled by car in 6.5 hours, 2 people in the wrong rooms, 5 laps walked on and around the train to find an employee, 29 hours of travel time with 3 hours of sleep, 2.5 hours of the train moving,  2 announcements about travel vs 4 announcements about the dining car, and 11 hours spent sitting in train stations. I do not fault Amtrak for the delays and cancellations. The winter storm with multiple feet of snow and temperatures in some locations reaching 50 below zero was out of their control. However, the lack of communication during the troubleshooting process prevented the passengers from having the opportunity to make informed decisions about their travel plans and potentially make other arrangements was frustrating and could have easily been resolved. My second annoyance with Amtrak is the lack of support when a train is cancelled. Yes, they do offer free rescheduling and a refund for cancellation, but not everyone has the luxury of having a flexible work schedule and accommodating family/friends that can allow them to leave a different day than originally planned or even worse, get back home. I can see how many people, if they landed in the same cancelled train situations that I found myself in, could have trouble getting back home and get to their jobs. In these situations, alternate travel accommodations should be provided. My last complaint is the lack of available staff on the train. When passengers had concerns and questions, it was difficult to find staff to help. All passengers were left unattended and allowed to wander while everyone's luggage sat out. Passengers could climb onto the train and in whatever room or seat without supervision to prevent them from taking someone else's spot. Unfortunately, I do not see myself considering taking Amtrak again and will not be recommending it to those I know. The only people I can recommend it to would be to people who have no schedule to keep, no valuables to protect, and no qualms with uncomfortable train station seating.","this winter my husband and i

375,trustpilot.com,"My recent Amtrak trip.This experience could be improved by avoiding Amtrak all together. My experience was planned as a bucket list type event. I spent a lot of money for sleeper car travel. Wifi access was advertised. I rode 4 different trains. There is no Wifi. Corporate Amtrak's lack of corporate awareness for truthfulness and customer service needs is the problem. They simply don't seem to give a flying Frito about even minimal service.The initial roomette trip was uneventful, aside from the gross smell, cramped accommodations and dire need of modernization.  There was one electrical outlet. The bathrooms often made my skin crawl. I was later to learn that coach had more access to more reliable outlets than the expensive cramped roomette. The attendant was great and the t.v. dinner was ok.The nightmare came on the return trip. I had booked this trip 2.5 months in advance. I booked a sleeper roomette  from Pittsburgh to Chicago. Two days after purchasing tickets, the roomette went out of commission. I was not notified. The change was ignored and my reservation stayed the same for 2.5 months - while the remaining rooms were filled. On the morning of my departure ""operations"" fixed things. When I arrived at the Pittsburgh station the attendant rudely barked that I was riding coach to Cleveland. She told me I booked it that way and if I had a problem - talk to the ticket clerk. Fat lot of good that did. He told me there were no other accommodations and that I just didn't know how to book reservations...next time get help from someone who knew the job. I was deeply insulted. Condescension did not improve matters. I assumed that double booking had occurred. It had not. Amtrak just didn't bother to address the problem till the last minute. As a result I was bumped into Coach from Pittsburgh to Cleveland and made to believe it was my problem.  At 3:00 a.m.,on a cold winter morning, I had to gather my belongings and walk to another car in which a sleeper emptied out. The one outlet in the room was so loose that I could not use my cpap. Arrival in Chicago was a relief. My only complaint with the metropolitan lounge in Chicago were the female drill sergeants at the reception desk. Manners always help. Those gals missed that class. I did not appreciate the repeated screamed reminders to display my green pass.After a 6 hour layover, I boarded my final train. By this time I was so exhausted and short of breath. My inhalers didn't help much. I rarely had the opportunity to remove my mask. There is no accommodation for Covid and my risk is significant....so a sleeper car was important at night.  When I arrived at my final destination 5 hours later, the attendant forgot to unload my cpap. I was absolutely exhausted. My insurance company will not replace this recent replacement. I face significant health issues as a direct result of Amtrak's ""service"". I have nothing but good things to say about the attendant. He could not have been more accommodating and helpful. He is not responsible for a broken system. Amtrak's deliberately negligent regard for passenger belongings assured that my cpap would be lost without constant vigilance. Unfortunately, Amtrak has no system for tracking carry on luggage that is stored in the entryway storage areas.  My only hope is the fact that I did label my baggage. In my opinion, today's Amtrak travel is abominable. I am writing this the day after return. I have spent 2 hours , at least, on the phone with customer relations. The little compensation that was offered was insulting. I have little hope of my item being returned. My guess is that it is already up for sale on craigslist.","my recent amtrak trip.this experience could be improved by avoiding amtrak all together. my experience was planned as a bucket list type

she told me i booked it that way and if i had a problem - talk to the ticket clerk. fat lot of good that did. he told me there were no other accommodations and that i just didn't know how to book reservations...next time get help from someone who knew the job. i was deeply insulted. condescension did not improve matters. i assumed that double booking had occurred. it had not. amtrak just didn't bother to address the problem till the last minute. as a result i was bumped into coach from pittsburgh to cleveland and made to believe it was my problem.  at 3:00 a.m.,on a cold winter morning, i had to gather my belongings and walk to another car in which a sleeper emptied out. the one outlet in the room was so loose that i could not use my cpap. arrival in chicago was a relief. my only complaint with the metropolitan lounge in chicago were the female drill sergeants at the reception desk. manners always help. those gals missed that class. i did not appreciate the repeated screamed reminders to display my green pass.after a 6 hour layover, i boarded my final train. by this time i was so exhausted and short of breath. my inhalers didn't help much. i rarely had the opportunity to remove my mask. there is no accommodation for covid and my risk is significant....so a sleeper car was important at night.  when i arrived at my final destination 5 hours later, the attendant forgot to unload my cpap. i was absolutely exhausted. my insurance company will not replace this recent replacement. i face significant health issues as a direct result of amtrak's ""service"". i have nothing but good things to say about the attendant. he could not have been more accommodating and helpful. he is not responsible for a broken system. amtrak's deliberately negligent regard for passenger belongings assured that my cpap would be lost without constant vigilance. unfortunately, amtrak has no system for tracking carry on luggage that is stored in the entryway storage areas.  my only hope is the fact that i did label my baggage. in my opinion, today's amtrak travel is abominable. i am writing this the day after return. i have spent 2 hours , at least, on the phone with customer relations. the little compensation that was offered was insulting. i have little hope of my item being returned. my guess is that it is already up for sale on craigslist.","['recent', 'amtrak', 'trip.this', 'experience', 'could', 'improved', 'avoiding', 'amtrak', 'together.', 'experience', 'planned', 'bucket', 'list', 'type', 'event.', 'spent', 'lot',

385,trustpilot.com,"AMTRAK VACATION DOES NOT EXIST!!!!!!!!!!So for any of you who know me know that me and my twin love to travel. We usually take a vacation trip for our birthday.  Well, this year we decided to pay homage to our father and ride the rails.  We had seen ads for AMTRAK Vacation and thought ""WOW that sounds fun, relaxing and we get to see the countryside.  We had seen these amazing pictures and videos of people enjoying these luxury trains with amazing views from big picture windows, fantastic meals and great rooms.  So we booked this very expensive trip to Niagara Falls, that included a roomette, priority boarding, meals, upgraded hotel room, Stage coach from Buffalo New York to our hotel in Niagara Falls New York close to the Falls and passage on Maiden of the Mist, our most expensive trip to date.   Yeah, were we in for a rude awakening!!!!  Our first red flag  was when a couple of weeks before our trip,  my twin received an email cancelling our Stage coach from Buffalo to Niagara Falls but per their policy(should have read that fine print) we were unable to cancel on our side.  It went downhill from there.  We got to Union Station and were going to check our bags but we weren't able to because we wouldn't get them back until we reached Buffalo.  Of course, we would need our clothes and toiletries for the ""luxury train"" that we would board in Chicago after our coach ride from Kansas, where we had an 8 hour layover, second red flag.   We thought it was worth the layover because we would be boarding our ""luxury train"" with our roomette.  Well, as you can tell from the pictures below it was a toilet closet.  Yep, that brown in the corner is a toilet and above that a sink that pulls out the wall.  They are also the steps up to the bunk that comes down from the ceiling.  For clarification on the pictures, I was standing outside the room, you can't stand when the bed is down, the blue curtains are part of the door, yep the ones touching the front of the bunk.  Oh and the straps, are to secure yourself up there so you don't fall off during the bumpy ride...no sleep for the weary travelers.  So I slept and sit beside a toilet the whole ride.  As you can also see in the pictures the train is old(probably in style when my Dad was a conductor and he died when we were fours months old)and it smelled like urine from previous passengers.  It was laughable!!! but certainly not funny.  Of course, we didn't use it...we trekked 2 to 5  cars over to use the restrooms in coach.  There was 1 folks yep I said 1 tiny shower stall for all the passengers(at least 12 rooms-double occupancy equals 24 folks)on the sleeping train to use and it was unaccessible.  We were unable to have a meal because the food was contaminated due to all the rain that was pouring into the train.  Our luggage also had to fit in the toilet closet with us.  There were no great vistas, you use the same rails as the freight trains and they have priority.  So you will find yourself stopped on the rails for hours.  Now after hauling luggage on and off of trains we finally get to our hotel(that we couldn't check in for more than 2 hours) we go to our upgraded double room and there's one double bed(after no sleep on the train)for two grown women to share and a view of the lumber yard across the street where we had to pay additional funds for incidentals.  Fortunately, we had ants(lots of ants) in our room so the hotel upgraded our room where we had a view of Canada, the nightly fireworks display and two double beds.  We were so tired we lost our first day in Niagara Falls.  We upgraded our tickets for Maiden of the Mist  to a tour of Niagara Falls well worth the extra money than stumbling around Niagara Falls with no idea of where to go, what to do, and how to get there.  Finally our last day I go downstairs to get coffee and realize that we have to check out of our room by 11 am and our train doesn't leave until shortly after midnight. So we either pay for another night or we schelp our luggage around for 13 hours or sit in a train station that long with our luggage. While dealing with the front desk at our hotel we are made aware that our accomodations and activities were booked through Price Line, while Amtrak paid Price Line 1/4th to 1/2 of what they charged us.All this to say AMTRAK VACATION is a hoax, scam or whatever you want to call it along those lines. If you're thinking AMTRAK then just DON'T!!!!!  Just fly and book through Price Line yourself.Niagara Falls is Amazing and an almost spiritual experience.","amtrak vacation does not exist!!!!!!!!!!so for any of you who know me know that me and my twin love to travel. we usually take a vacation trip for our birthday.  well, this year we decided to pay homage to our father and ride the rails.  we had seen ads for amtrak vacation and thought ""wow that sounds fun, relaxing and we get to see the countryside.  we had seen these amazing pictures and videos of people enjoying these luxury trains with amazing views from big picture windows, fantastic meals and great rooms.  so we booked this very expensive trip to niagara falls, that included a roomette, priority boarding, meals, upgraded hotel room, stage coach from buffalo new york to our hotel in niagara falls new york close to the falls and passage on maiden of the mist, our most expensive trip to date.   yeah, were we in for a rude awakening!!!!

386,trustpilot.com,"… Mind you I haven’t taken a trip with Amtrack in about 16 years my mom probably 10 years…Back then we had viewing cars and the trains were clean the food was great. It Was a wonderful experience! We had fresh cooked food with the chefs that cooked our meals, There was waitresses and waiters…we had real silverware glasses etc. it felt just like a Restaurant on wheels ..fancy though! The rooms were very clean the windows on the trains were clean it looks like the advertisement they show now! 😳However mom and I decided to take a train trip to Chicago because we remember how enjoyable it was back then. After getting on the train we had a room with a restroom inside Which was not to clean and sleeping on the top bunk I smelt the exhaust from the engine which was not good. They definitely need to do some updates on the train and fixings… When getting ready to have our meals we were pretty excited,come to find out there is like five things on the menu for lunch and dinner and when you get them it is worse than a TV dinner… I don’t know who came up with this menu but the food is horrible it comes in a tin tray and It is placed on the table so when you come to eat there it is… The service that we had in the dinner car was not good at allthe people had attitudes the train conductors servers workers etc. took 4 tables nobody could eat at, I guess was their break area they did announce when they were on break… When asking to get a mixed drink we were told that you had to pay for them… When you get a room you are allowed to have one mix drink per person in that room for your dinner I actually had to show the lady what was said in the articles in order to get one… Also there is unlimited drinks however the lady who took care of the cash register and the café had an attitude and said you only get one I had to again show her my advertisement of Amtrack again and she got an attitude and said she’s gonna be talking to somebody about that! I did get sodas however… I’m sure these people are a little shorthanded but when they give attitude and mouth off at the customers and don’t clean up on the tables it definitely does not want me to come back… The food again was not good at all we finally bought a hotdog from the menu. sad thing is that was delicious compared to what we get for having a room!  …That hotdog was the best hotdog after eating all those nasty meals that I really didn’t eat too much of because you couldn’t ..they were so bad… Oatmeal was the best thing on the menu for breakfast😳 I would definitely love for the CEOs to take a train ride from Chicago  to San Antonio or San Antonio to Chicago… We very disappointing and so is my mother… The trains are dirty the windows haven’t been cleaned and I don’t know how long🤷‍♀️ I have to say the guy that took care of us in our room did a great job! I didn’t see  him much, I believe the lady in the café car had him running back-and-forth like a crazy man dropping off meals etc. the attendant in the café car also told everybody pretty much when they had their conversations at front where everybody could hear she said “these people expect us to work 24 hours a day “well I’m gonna take my break she said… and if I’m not mistaken I even had heard them say that everybody got a raise at the top except for them! talking their personal stuff in front of everybody was not good… The atmosphere was just pretty negative The food was gross The train needed updating they need to clean the windows so we could see out better they definitely need to put the viewing car back!! not having that we were so disappointed… I asked the Attendant on the train Why we are getting a heated up pretty much TV dinner and where are the chef’s  that cooks anymore? She said those are on some other trains but not this one. I don’t understand why the other trains  can have good food on theirs and this one has nasty food and no viewing car but some of the others do? I found out through the Chicago lounge personnel that they only have certain trains that have viewing cars with the homemade food where there is a chef that cooks them… If you look at the advertisements they make it look so good and you think everything is the same but it is not so if you take a train make sure you look at what you get real close and ask questions because they make it look really good… ours was not a good experience at all… The only thing I really enjoyed was the ride and talking to some of the passengers… I really hope they look into the exhaust fumes that are getting into these rooms up top that I do believe is going to be a problem one day if somebody does not take care of that it is very strong and if you have kids up top it’s not gonna be good!… The only reason this one is getting two stars is because the ride is enjoyable the view is great! I really hope someone does their homework and checks into this and see how bad Amtrack is going downhill !! I did get $300back🤷‍♀️Wow!🙄 I hope Amtrack changes!!","… mind you i haven’t taken a trip with amtrack in about 16 years my mom probably 10 years…back then we had viewing cars and the trains were clean the food was great. it was a wonderful experience! we had fresh cooked food with the chefs that cooked our meals, there was waitresses and waiters…we had real silverware glasses etc. it felt just like a restaurant on wheels ..fancy though! the rooms were very clean the windows on the trains were clean it looks like the advertisement they show now! 😳however mom and i decided to take a train trip to chicago because we remember how enjoyable it was back then. after getting on the train we had a room with a restroom inside which was not to clean and sleeping on the top bunk i smelt the exhaust from the engine which was not good. they definitely need to do some updates on the train and fixings… when getting ready to have our meals we were pretty excited,come to find out there is like five things on the menu for lunch and dinner and when you get them it is worse than a tv dinner… i don’t know who came up with this menu but the food is horrible it comes in a tin tray and it is placed on the table so when you come to eat there it is… the service that we had in the dinner car was not good at allthe people had attitudes the train conductors servers workers etc. took 4 tables nobody could eat at, i guess was their break area they did announce when they were on break… when asking to get a mixed drink we were told that you had to pay for them… when you get a room you are allowed to have one mix drink per person in that room for your dinner i actually had to show the lady what was said in the articles in order to get one… also there is unlimited drinks however the lady who took care of the cash register and the café had an attitude and said you only get one i had to again show her my advertisement of amtrack again and she got an attitude and said she’s gonna be talking to somebody about that! i did get sodas however… i’m sure these people are a little shorthanded but when they give attitude and mouth off at the customers and don’t clean up on the tables it definitely does not want me to come back… the food again was not good at all we finally bought a hotdog from the menu. sad thing is that was delicious compared to what we get for having a room!  …that hotdog was the best hotdog after eating all those nasty meals that i really didn’t eat too much of because you couldn’t ..they were so bad… oatmeal was the best thing on the menu for breakfast😳 i would definitely love for the ceos to take a train ride from chicago  to san antonio or san antonio to chicago… we very disappointing and so is my mother… the trains are dirty the windows haven’t been cleaned and i don’t know how long🤷‍♀️ i have to say the guy that took care of us in our room did a great job! i didn’t see  him much, i believe the lady in the café car had him running back-and-forth like a crazy man dropping off meals etc. the attendant in the café car also told everybody pretty much when they had their conversations at front where everybody could hear she said “these people expect us to work 24 hours a day “well i’m gonna take my break she said… and if i’m not mistaken i even had heard them say that everybody got a raise at the top except for them! talking their personal stuff in front of everybody was not good… the atmosphere was just pretty negative the food was gross the train needed updating they need to clean the windows so we could see out better they definitely need to put the viewing car back!!

Which made it difficult to get up at 7am for the planned Tour of the Glacier National Park included in my Amtrak Package. Every Train during my 2 day stay was delayed hrs. The Train leaving the day before my departure was delayed 12 hrs. People were sleeping in the Glacial Park Lodge for hrs waiting for their train.

The Porter at some point made an announcement saying we would all be refunded 100% of what we paid for that leg of the trip, And then later on went on and told us we would be refunded 100% of our entire trip.

399,trustpilot.com,"Recently my friends and I attempted an Amtrak roundtrip from KC to San Diego. It was an extremely unpleasant experience. Not only were we unexpectedly told we were not allowed in the dining car due to CoVid (only the sleeper car passengers were) minutes after being awoken from our uncomfortable seats with an announcement telling us breakfast was served, but we weren't afforded pillows or blankets for our 2-night trip one way (no sleeper cars were even left when I booked). The train stopped after 12 hours so we could wait for the new conductor to be taxied in which took about half an hour (how they didn’t realize ahead of time they would need a replacement, I’d like to know). The train was going so slowly, a rabbit could have kept pace, and with how miserable the trip was panning out to be, at some point we gave up entirely on our destination and asked to be dropped off at the next town.  The conductor rolled right on by even as we pressed every alarm button we could find. Finally, we had to physically locate someone in the dining car who then located the conductor.  He acted cocky, smirking when we tried to explain what happened, and took no responsibility for our plight.  He brushed us off, saying we weren’t waiting in the ‘designated car’ to alight (???).  We ended up having to wait another hour to get off at the next stop and weren't even offered a taxi ride back so we had to pay for our own. Altogether, it was the worst vacation nightmare of my life so far.  I would HIGHLY warn anyone considering taking a train in the States.  Apparently, Amtrak is quite a monopoly, and poor customer service is what happens when there’s no competition.  I did give them one last chance to redeem themselves by filing for a refund request and were told that was their normal operating procedures.

When I sat here, a conductor just told me I have to keep my bag out of the aisle, so I put my hard suitcase in the corner of the bench opposite me and my big bag next to me on my bench (there are no overhead storage shelves in the cafe car). A couple hours into the trip, a man comes and asks if anyone is sitting across from me. I said no, and that he could adjust my suitcase however he needed. There’s 75% of the bench still available for him. He looked at me like I was an idiot and said “can’t you put it under the table?” And I said I didn’t think it would fit under the table, and I was looking around for another solution when another Amtrak conductor came over and said “ma’am you’re blocking the seat.” I said “I know, I was told to keep my bags out of the aisle but I don’t know where else to put it” and he said, again, “well you’re blocking a seat”. I said “where would you like me to put my bag?” and he basically laughed, looked around, had no suggestions and just again said he didn’t know but I’m blocking a seat and need to figure it out. I pulled my hard case suitcase into my lap against the cafe table, and the conductor says to the other man “when we get to NYC, you can have your pick of any seat on the train (:”. I’m embarrassed and I’m really upset by this interaction. I don’t know what I did so wrong for these two men to look at me and treat me so condescendingly, like I was being difficult when all i asked was “where would you like me to put my bag?”.

I’m not trying to be difficult, I was trying to remedy the situation and the amtrak conductor absolutely treated me like I was an idiot causing this middle aged man such an inconvenience.","i’m a young (22yo) woman and i was traveling home alone from va to ct. i sat in the cafe car to get some work done, and i have a suitcase and a big bag with me. when i sat here, a conductor just told me i have to keep my bag out of the aisle, so i put my hard suitcase in the corner of the bench opposite me and my big bag next to me on my bench (there are no overhead storage shelves in the cafe car). a couple hours into the trip, a man comes and asks if anyone is sitting across from me. i said no, and that he could adjust my suitcase however he needed. there’s 75% of the bench still available for him. he looked at me like i was an idiot and said “can’t you put it under the table?” and i said i didn’t think it would fit under the table, and i was looking around for another solution when another amtrak conductor came over and said “ma’am you’re blocking the seat.” i said “i know, i was told to keep my bags out of the aisle but i don’t know where else to put it” and he said, again, “well you’re blocking a seat”. i said “where would you like me to put my bag?” and he basically laughed, looked around, had no suggestions and just again said he didn’t know but i’m blocking a seat and need to figure it out. i pulled my hard case suitcase into my lap against the cafe table, and the conductor says to the other man “when we get to nyc, you can have your pick of any seat on the train (:”. i’m embarrassed and i’m really upset by this interaction. i don’t know what i did so wrong for these two men to look at me and treat me so condescendingly, like i was being difficult when all i asked was “where would you like me to put my bag?”. the whole car definitely heard and now i feel uncomfortable and awkward and i’m so upset that the conductor treated me like that, and coddled this grown, 60-something year old man as if i was being such an inconvenience for his life. just tell me a place i can put my bag, i’m not intentionally blocking a seat!! i’m not trying to be difficult, i was trying to remedy the situation and the amtrak conductor absolutely treated me like i was an idiot causing this middle aged man such an inconvenience.","['i’m', 'young', '(22yo)', 'woman', 'traveling', 'home', 'alone', 'va', 'ct.', 'sat', 'cafe', 'car', 'get', 'work', 'done,', 'suitcase', 'big', 'bag', 'me.', 'sat', 'here,', 'conductor', 'told', 'keep', 'bag', 'aisle,', 'put', 'hard', 'suitcase', 'corner', 'bench', 'opposite', 'big', 'bag', 'next', 'bench', '(there', 'overhead', 'storage', 'shelves', 'cafe', 'car).', 'couple', 'hours', 'trip,', 'man', 'comes', 'asks', 'anyone', 'sitting', 'across', 'me.', 'said', 'no,', 'could', 'adjust', 'suitcase', 'however', 'needed.', 'there’s', '75%', 'bench', 'still', 'available', 'him.', 'looked', 'like', 'idiot', 'said', '“can’t', 'put', 'table?”', 'said', 'didn’t', 'think', 'would', 'fit', 'table,', 'looking', 'around', 'another', 'solution', 'another', 'amtrak', 'conductor', 'came', 'said', '“ma’am', 'you’re', 'blocking', 'seat.”', 'said', '“i', 'know,', 'told', 'keep', 'bags', 'aisle', 'don’t', 'know', 'else', 'put', 'it”', 'said,', 'again,', '“well', 'you’re', 'blocking', 'seat”.', 'said', '“where', 'would', 'like', 'put', 'bag?”', 'basically', 'laughed,', 'looked', 'around,', 'suggestions', 'said', 'didn’t', 'know', 'i’m', 'blocking', 'seat', 'need', 'figure', 'out.', 'pulled', 'hard', 'case', 'suitcase', 'lap', 'cafe', 'table,', 'conductor', 'says', 'man', '“when', 'get', 'nyc,', 'pick', 'seat', 'train', '(:”.', 'i’m', 'embarrassed', 'i’m', 'really', 'upset', 'interaction.', 'don’t', 'know', 'wrong', 'two', 'men', 'look', 'treat', 'condescendingly,', 'like', 'difficult', 'asked', '“where', 'would', 'like', 'put', 'bag?”.', 'whole', 'car', 'definitely', 'heard', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'awkward', 'i’m', 'upset', 'conductor', 'treated', 'like', 'that,', 'coddled', 'grown,', '60-something', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'inconvenience', 'life.', 'tell', 'place', 'put', 'bag,', 'i’m', 'intentionally', 'blocking', 'seat!!', 'i’m', 'trying', 'difficult,', 'trying', 'remedy', 'situation', 'amtrak', 'conductor', 'absolutely', 'treated', 'like', 'idiot', 'causing', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'inconvenience.']",-0.9711,0.487345679

426,trustpilot.com,"If there were less stars I would rate it at that. We have travelled by car, airplane, and cruises, so we were excited to try out the train.  Our start point was in Provo Utah at what is a booth with some seats in it. There is No Restroom, no ticket service, no one there, a gross pay phone (not sure it works) and that is it. We were ready for our 4:35 boarding on 7/5/2022, but there was no train for 2 more hours.  Okay, we know issues come up when traveling.  When the train arrived I had to wait while one of the train employees kicked a man and his service dog off the train, no idea why, so I can't really judge that, but it was still surprising, especially since there is nothing at that stop.  After getting on the train, with no instruction for riding safely, we settled down only to hear the person on the speaker talk to us in an extremely rude fashion.  Only a couple of the employees were pleasant, but we were excited and tried to get along.  The observation car is really nice, but they do not keep the windows clean.  The restrooms were so upsetting. They were very unclean and we never saw them attended to.  My husband was never able to connect to the wifi on his laptop. The train had to stop multiple times, with no explanation to us, nor were we allowed off, and we crawled along at 5 miles per hour so, so much that our train was 5 hours behind by the time we reached Chicago.  I think part of the issue may have been caused because the train was so behind they hauled at high speed during the night to make up time and that caused some engine issues and was scary the way that speed felt in our seats. They hit a vehicle at some point, no injuries, but knocked out the electrical system som. It truly felt like were treated like prisoners on this train. We were not allowed off the train, except a couple of times for a couple of minutes, no exaggeration! This was the California Zephyr experience and I gave them the benefit of the doubt, until we took it back and the only difference was the man on the speaker this time was fun and informational. Other staff really need to find new jobs, they are not people friendly. The New Orleans train was so much better, friendly people, they cleaned the restrooms, and ran on time.  I felt traumatized by the CA Zephyr.  I had bruises from being thrown around, and my elderly father sliced his arm on something while trying to walk the isles.  There is too much to add, but my final nightmarish experience was getting back to the Provo Utah train stop on 7/13, we were supposed to be back at 9:26 p.m. and we did not get back until after 2 a.m. There were 3 ladies who were at that stop as well, one elderly lady, one with a prosthetic leg and one middle age helping them. They let them off the train and without any care at all for their well being at this bench stop, told them to call a taxi, I informed the train employee there were no taxis here and he said ""that's what happens when Uber comes to town"". I let him know we have never had taxis here. My  point here is they do not care about people in the least, not at all. Also, if you think having a sleeper car will make your trip better, guess again, these ladies had a sleeper car and they had a very loud noise the whole time in their car it was so loud they couldn't sleep and didn't feel well, but the train employees would not investigate, or do anything about it. They were able to use the dining car, because they had sleepers, which was so frustrating since I had been excited to dine in the dining car and when on board was informed it was only for sleeper cars, even if you wanted to pay for your meal, anyway these ladies told me they were also treated rudely by the staff in the dining car.  I won't even tell the story about how rude I was treated in the pitiful cafe.  This train needs to be completely overhauled, updated, have hand rails installed, maybe add some trains for scheduling help, and some of the crew need to replaced.  I highly suggest Amtrak do some undercover investigating on their trains and fix serious issues. We will never ride with Amtrak ever again! I will not recommend it to anyone I speak with either.  It was very disheartening for our first train trip.","if there were less stars i would rate it at that. we have travelled by car, airplane, and cruises, so we were excited to try out the train.  our start point was in provo utah at what is a booth with some seats in it. there is no restroom, no ticket service, no one there, a gross pay phone (not sure it works) and that is it. we were ready for our 4:35 boarding on 7/5/2022, but there was no train for 2 more hours.  okay, we know issues come up when traveling.  when the train arrived i had to wait while one of the train employees kicked a man and his service dog off the train, no idea why, so i can't really judge that, but it was still surprising, especially since there is nothing at that stop.  after getting on the train, with no instruction for riding safely, we settled down only to hear the person on the speaker talk to us in an extremely rude fashion.  only a couple of the employees were pleasant, but we were excited and tried to get along.  the observation car is really nice, but they do not keep the windows clean.  the restrooms were so upsetting. they were very unclean and we never saw them attended to.  my husband was never able to connect to the wifi on his laptop. the train had to stop multiple times, with no explanation to us, nor were we allowed off, and we crawled along at 5 miles per hour so, so much that our train was 5 hours behind by the time we reached chicago.  i think part of the issue may have been caused because the train was so behind they hauled at high speed during the night to make up time and that caused some engine issues and was scary the way that speed felt in our seats. they hit a vehicle at some point, no injuries, but knocked out the electrical system som. it truly felt like were treated like prisoners on this train. we were not allowed off the train, except a couple of times for a couple of minutes, no exaggeration! this was the california zephyr experience and i gave them the benefit of the doubt, until we took it back and the only difference was the man on the speaker this time was fun and informational. other staff really need to find new jobs, they are not people friendly. the new orleans train was so much better, friendly people, they cleaned the restrooms, and ran on time.  i felt traumatized by the ca zephyr.  i had bruises from being thrown around, and my elderly father sliced his arm on something while trying to walk the isles.  there is too much to add, but my final nightmarish experience was getting back to the provo utah train stop on 7/13, we were supposed to be back at 9:26 p.m. and we did not get back until after 2 a.m. there were 3 ladies who were at that stop as well, one elderly lady, one with a prosthetic leg and one middle age helping them. they let them off the train and without any care at all for their well being at this bench stop, told them to call a taxi, i informed the train employee there were no taxis here and he said ""that's what happens when uber comes to town"". i let him know we have never had taxis here. my  point here is they do not care about people in the least, not at all. also, if you think having a sleeper car will make your trip better, guess again, these ladies had a sleeper car and they had a very loud noise the whole time in their car it was so loud they couldn't sleep and didn't feel well, but the train employees would not investigate, or do anything about it. they were able to use the dining car, because they had sleepers, which was so frustrating since i had been excited to dine in the dining car and when on board was informed it was only for sleeper cars, even if you wanted to pay for your meal, anyway these ladies told me they were also treated rudely by the staff in the dining car.  i won't even tell the story about how rude i was treated in the pitiful cafe.  this train needs to be completely overhauled, updated, have hand rails installed, maybe add some trains for scheduling help, and some of the crew need to replaced.  i highly suggest amtrak do some undercover investigating on their trains and fix serious issues. we will never ride with amtrak ever again!

We also were unclear who our attendant was so that made it difficult to get help when needed. Then the train was delayed a total of six hours when all was said and done and walking around Denver at 7pm would have been much more ideal than waking around there at 1am. However, the train being late is just #trainlife and you have to expect it. And the staff warmed up once we got on our way.

465,trustpilot.com,"I had the worse traveling experience ever on Amtrak from June 1, 2022. I boarded the Silver Star 91 train at Newark, NJ heading to Kissimmee, Fl.  Before I boarded the train, the conductor told me to sit in seat 48. There was a white woman on her way to Miami in one of the seats. when I informed her that the conductor told me to sit next to her she moved into another seat until the conductor caught her in the new seat and told her she had to return next to me. According to the same white woman she was supposed to be in seat 27 but was seated in the wrong seat when I boarded the train because some person who doesn't understand English was in her seat. she said she decided to sit in the spot where I met her because she didn't want to get into an altercation with the non-English speaking man. She kept condemning this passenger for not speaking English. The entire trip she was extremely dreadful. She was drinking alcohol and smoking weed. She even purposely touched my thigh without my consent to ""reassure"" me that the wild coughing she was doing wasn't because of covid. I was wearing my mask, but she wasn't and made that connection. she was playing her music loudly and was talking loud to the point of yelling on her phone. She was repeatedly punching and pinching herself. She was cursing at the conductor demanding a seat change and threatened to shoot him. I was asleep when the confrontation started and the commotion woke me up, so I was able to hear everything she said. She even used the N-word. When we got to Washington, D.C. I told the conductor about the belligerent person I was seating next to. He said he would keep an eye out for another seat for me. I was not moved nor was she removed. She was constantly back and forth between her seat during the evening, so I was able to not be bothered much and sleep some. Then in the middle of the night, she grabbed all of her luggage and left to go to another seat to sleep. I thought the conductor finally moved her, so I was slightly relieved. However, at around 2:55 am she returned with another conductor arguing about sleeping in the wrong seat. She did the whole spiel about why she moved from this seat, but the conductor didn't care because he needed those seats for the customers boarding at the next stop. She was cursing loudly at this conductor too. Once again it woke me and some of the surrounding passengers. She used the N-word a second time, but this time it seemed she was directing it to the conductor because he is Black. The entire ride she complained to me about everything wrong with this trip on Amtrak. This is my first time going to Florida and I truly regret using the Amtrak. I was planning on taking a trip cross country on Amtrak in December, but doubt I will ever ride with this company again. I had an extremely unpleasant and unsafe trip because of this woman. I was shocked that the conductor allowed her to stay on the train after making such a threat. She was threatening to shoot your employee and they did not take that seriously. Especially since this was a week after a tragic shooting that left innocent people dead. We are close in proximity and in a closed area. What if she attacked me or the other passengers? The passenger in front of her said she felt so bad for me because she heard & witnessed everything. Even suggested that maybe the woman should sit next to someone white like her. There's a brochure in the chair pocket talking about customer safety instructions. the first thing it says is to tell your conductor when you see something suspicious or unusual, but they already knew the situation, and the conductors did nothing. They just ignored her. I dont want to believe that this behavior was tolerated because she is a white woman, but it's hard not to think that when such behavior is dismissed and other Black passengers have been kicked off for less. On top of that, the train was 3+ hours delayed. When I contacted Amtrak about my ride they gave a dismissive response about telling the conductors, but the conductor was told AND the irate passenger got into it with FOUR conductors about her behavior! This was terrible customer service and an inadequate response to something like this.

this was terrible customer service and an inadequate response to something like this. this isn't my 1st time on the amtrak, and there have been other off-putting experiences, but this is certainly the worst. i'll stick to flying. this was ridiculous.","['worse', 'traveling', 'experience', 'ever', 'amtrak', 'june', '1,', '2022.', 'boarded', 'silver', 'star', '91', 'train', 'newark,', 'nj', 'heading', 'kissimmee,', 'fl.', 'boarded', 'train,', 'conductor', 'told', 'sit', 'seat', '48.', 'white', 'woman', 'way', 'miami', 'one', 'seats.', 'informed', 'conductor', 'told', 'sit', 'next', 'moved', 'another', 'seat', 'conductor', 'caught', 'new', 'seat', 'told', 'return', 'next', 'me.', 'according', 'white', 'woman', 'supposed', 'seat', '27', 'seated', 'wrong', 'seat', 'boarded', 'train', 'person', 'understand', 'english', 'seat.', 'said', 'decided', 'sit', 'spot', 'met', 'want', 'get', 'altercation', 'non-english', 'speaking', 'man.', 'kept', 'condemning', 'passenger', 'speaking', 'english.', 'entire', 'trip', 'extremely', 'dreadful.', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'smoking', 'weed.', 'even', 'purposely', 'touched', 'thigh', 'without', 'consent', '""reassure""', 'wild', 'coughing', 'covid.', 'wearing', 'mask,', 'made', 'connection.', 'playing', 'music', 'loudly', 'talking', 'loud', 'point', 'yelling', 'phone.', 'repeatedly', 'punching', 'pinching', 'herself.', 'cursing', 'conductor', 'demanding', 'seat', 'change', 'threatened', 'shoot', 'him.', 'asleep', 'confrontation', 'started', 'commotion', 'woke', 'up,', 'able', 'hear', 'everything', 'said.', 'even', 'used', 'n-word.', 'got', 'washington,', 'd.c.', 'told', 'conductor', 'belligerent', 'person', 'seating', 'next', 'to.', 'said', 'would', 'keep', 'eye', 'another', 'seat', 'me.', 'moved', 'removed.', 'constantly', 'back', 'forth', 'seat', 'evening,', 'able', 'bothered', 'much', 'sleep', 'some.', 'middle', 'night,', 'grabbed', 'luggage', 'left', 'go', 'another', 'seat', 'sleep.', 'thought', 'conductor', 'finally', 'moved', 'her,', 'slightly', 'relieved.', 'however,', 'around', '2:55', 'returned', 'another', 'conductor', 'arguing', 'sleeping', 'wrong', 'seat.', 'whole', 'spiel', 'moved', 'seat,', 'conductor', 'care', 'needed', 'seats', 'customers', 'boarding', 'next', 'stop.', 'cursing', 'loudly', 'conductor', 'too.', 'woke', 'surrounding', 'passengers.', 'used', 'n-word', 'second', 'time,', 'time', 'seemed', 'directing', 'conductor', 'black.', 'entire', 'ride', 'complained', 'everything', 'wrong', 'trip', 'amtrak.', 'first', 'time', 'going', 'florida', 'truly', 'regret', 'using', 'amtrak.', 'planning', 'taking', 'trip', 'cross', 'country', 'amtrak', 'december,', 'doubt', 'ever', 'ride', 'company', 'again.', 'extremely', 'unpleasant', 'unsafe', 'trip', 'woman.', 'shocked', 'conductor', 'allowed', 'stay', 'train', 'making', 'threat.', 'threatening', 'shoot', 'employee', 'take', 'seriously.', 'especially', 'since', 'week', 'tragic', 'shooting', 'left', 'innocent', 'people', 'dead.', 'close', 'proximity', 'closed', 'area.', 'attacked', 'passengers?', 'passenger', 'front', 'said', 'felt', 'bad', 'heard', '&', 'witnessed', 'everything.', 'even', 'suggested', 'maybe', 'woman', 'sit', 'next', 'someone', 'white', 'like', 'her.', ""there's"", 'brochure', 'chair', 'pocket', 'talking', 'customer', 'safety', 'instructions.', 'first', 'thing', 'says', 'tell', 'conductor', 'see', 'something', 'suspicious', 'unusual,', 'already', 'knew', 'situation,', 'conductors', 'nothing.', 'ignored', 'her.', 'dont', 'want', 'believe', 'behavior', 'tolerated', 'white', 'woman,', 'hard', 'think', 'behavior', 'dismissed', 'black', 'passengers', 'kicked', 'less.', 'top', 'that,', 'train', '3+', 'hours', 'delayed.', 'contacted', 'amtrak', 'ride', 'gave', 'dismissive', 'response', 'telling', 'conductors,', 'conductor', 'told', 'irate', 'passenger', 'got', 'four', 'conductors', 'behavior!', 'terrible', 'customer', 'service', 'inadequate', 'response', 'something', 'like', 'this.', '1st', 'time', 'amtrak,', 'off-putting', 'experiences,', 'certainly', 'worst.', ""i'll"", 'stick', 'flying.', 'ridiculous.']",-0.9983,0.433080226

The food in the dining car on the first three trains was exceptional. (though the selections were the same on all the trains that had a dining car and so, was quite repetitive.)Problems we experienced:We assumed this vacation was a group vacation and only after booking it, were we made aware that it was considered an independent vacation. The trip was not nearly as it was described. On the 6 trains we rode, there was never a shower on the floor with the roomettes. The roomettes are so small that when the bed is down, there is only a foot of space in which to stand and it was all but impossible to change clothes in that area. The upper bunk is so close to the ceiling on all but one train, that it was claustrophobic, not comfortable and difficult to get into for anyone over the age of 70. Customers should be made aware of that. My husband described it as being in a tomb.The restrooms on all the trains were not well kept and, in some cases, were dirty and had overflowing receptacles for used paper towels. That was a health hazard. Not acceptable.And a roomette with a commode in it?! If it were used, it would be like eating and sitting in a bathroom. Might be OK if a person is traveling alone, but without any privacy, it is not acceptable for those traveling with a companion or another individual.With the exception of one hotel, none of the hotels were in walking distance to the Amtrak station or to the activities that were included as part of the vacation which required hiring transportation to the hotels or tour pick up sites, to and from. We declined to use the voucher for hop on and off in Los Angeles as it would have cost $60 in transportation fees to use that voucher. Unacceptable. The Westin Bonaventure was a lovely hotel but there was nothing within walking distance except homeless people in tents. No restaurants or stores or acrivities.On three of the trains we rode, there was no dining car or observation car. We were told we would get 3 course dinners. The cafe car (which apparently replaced the dining car on those trains) provided food that was like something you might get in a highschool cafeteria. (A prepackaged brownie is not a great dessert!) The entre, heated in a plastic dish, was barely eatable. Unacceptable. The observations cars were also removed on those trains.had we known about these removals, we would not have booked on those trains.Only one of the 6 trains had WIFI. We were led to believe the trains did have WIFI. On the train from Chicago to Seattle, the Amtrak employee told me,“ I know it says there is WIFI but that really isn’t the case!)Because the trains were frequently late (over 2 hours, 4 hours in one case) we only had a day in each city, rather than the day and a half or two days which it appeared we would have.We were aware that our trip from Chicago back to Indianapolis would be via a Greyhound bus. What we were not aware of is that when we missed that bus due to our Amtrak train arriving more than 45 minutes later than scheduled into Chicago and we had to get our checked luggage (there was only an hour scheduled between the train arrival and our bus leaving.

500,trustpilot.com,"The five star because of the hospitable and kind staff. First encounter was Elizabeth (Liz) at the Orlando Sligh station. With a smile Liz did not tire of answering my questions.  I approached her three different times while I waited for my train.This was my first use of Amtrak. Liz was friendly, informative and welcoming. Then aboard the sleeper all the way to NY and back I met with the busiest, most diligent and hospitable Service Attendants ever.  Their goal, obviously was to please. My most favorite in the sleeper wereRodney, John and Preston. These guys were also outstanding in personality with a great sense of good humor, while waiting on everyone hand and foot.  The only guy serving in the pantry during all three meals going and coming (forgot his name) was also very professional and friendly.  My roomette was cozy and quaint. It had a toilet and sink with running water, so clever and useful. It had toilet  paper and soap, just like a hotel. I would have no problem traveling in a roomette again.  I love to fly, love airplanes but you can't roam around the airplane. You can't get coffee anytime you want it on the airplane. You can't walk to the diner or snack bar on an airplane.

I had booked the tickets several months ago and had done extensive research as to the amount of baggage 3 pax are allowed to check and carry on. We had several 24"" sq boxes to check which is clearly allowed by Amtrak (as long as under 50lbs). Unfortunately for us, the two women working the baggage check were some of the most aggressive, unhelpful and unfriendly people I have ever dealt with. First, they complained profusely that we had boxes, although Amtrak policy allows shipping boxes. Then they, and others, complained profusely that I'd put 'Fragile' stickers on the boxes (nothing we packed was breakable - the stickers merely an attempt to encourage safe handling - which they told me wouldn't happen as the boxes would get thrown around anyway!). Only when I finally said, ""just take the stickers off the boxes!"" did they stop complaining about them - so why give us such a hard time in the first place?!  Then, when it was discovered one box was overweight, it was as if it made them happy to reject our box! We then split our belongings into multiple boxes so as to lighten, and the only other thing that made them happy was collecting all the fees for extra boxes, baggage and bike-shipping - which they accused me of trying to sneak through (?!!)

In the end, when I said about certification for emotional support of my dog the same person allowed me to carry the dog. The person said that if this is emotional support I was no supppsed to pay fee for the pet. By reaching Washington DC Union Station, I went to Amtrak Tickets Box to ask how I can return paid money for carrying the pet since the staff on train said I don’t have to pay for emotional support animal. I met supervisor, the Mr Banks, who in emotional, far from professional way, start scream on me about Amtrak working just with service dogs and have nothing to do with emotional support. Mr Banks, called himself supervisor  and resist to give any assistance with reaching out his farther management. I was so stressed out and confused by different information from different unprofessional staff of Amtrak. I just left in distress and called the hot line of Amtrak . The lady on the phone with hot line of Amtrak told me about Amtrak no having special policy for emotional support animal but she said I allowed to carry the pet on my lap since it’s emotional support. Also I asked to connect me to department in order to leave complain for Mr Banks. I never got the chance to reach the department because waiting on the phone line took more time than expected so I left request for call back. No one  from Amtrak never reach me to make my complain about Mr Banks in life.

For the first time on Amtrak staff asked me close the bag. On my question why she asked me to do that the lady start yell on me and advised me no to show up on her eyes and walk to the last car so she can’t see me. I hope Amtrak has the cameras with recorded sound to track such unprofessionalism of the staff and stop abuse of customer. Moreover, the website ask for release form for the pet. I haven’t been ask for such form on traiN NYC-Washington 12 April 2022. On train Washington-Nyc 15 April no one ask me the form either. But in Union Washington train station theory in tickets box ask to fill the form and was asking no in nice way to show up if my carrying bag be able to close with my dog in. It was no great experience for my 7 month puppy, 6am in the morning, carrying her in and out as a toy, in order to show up the staff of Amtrak how works specialized for up to 16 pounds dogs  bag. And I see no reason for this because no one ask anyway for the form on train itself. So why the staff of Amtrak stress out customers who paying for service in such way. I’m asking to check all possible cameras in order to confirm all provided by me information above and consider my complain seriously and provide corresponding commission or discount for paid tickets on 12/15 April 2022 for me experiencing stress caused by staff of Amtrak.

farther management. i was so stressed out and confused by different information from different unprofessional staff of amtrak. i just left in distress and called the hot line of amtrak . the lady on the phone with hot line of amtrak told me about amtrak no having special policy for emotional support animal but she said i allowed to carry the pet on my lap since it’s emotional support. also i asked to connect me to department in order to leave complain for mr banks. i never got the chance to reach the department because waiting on the phone line took more time than expected so i left request for call back. no one  from amtrak never reach me to make my complain about mr banks in life. on my trip back to nyc on 6:20am april 15 2022 from washington dc i met again unqualified unprofessional rude staff of amtrak. the lady ( unfortunately didn’t get chance to get the name since she was stressing me out and acting rude ), who met me in front of the train, ask me to close the carrying bag with the dog. for the first time on amtrak staff asked me close the bag. on my question why she asked me to do that the lady start yell on me and advised me no to show up on her eyes and walk to the last car so she can’t see me. i hope amtrak has the cameras with recorded sound to track such unprofessionalism of the staff and stop abuse of customer. moreover, the website ask for release form for the pet. i haven’t been ask for such form on train nyc-washington 12 april 2022. on train washington-nyc 15 april no one ask me the form either. but in union washington train station theory in tickets box ask to fill the form and was asking no in nice way to show up if my carrying bag be able to close with my dog in. it was no great experience for my 7 month puppy, 6am in the morning, carrying her in and out as a toy, in order to show up the staff of amtrak how works specialized for up to 16 pounds dogs  bag. and i see no reason for this because no one ask anyway for the form on train itself. so why the staff of amtrak stress out customers who paying for service in such way. i’m asking to check all possible cameras in order to confirm all provided by me information above and consider my complain seriously and provide corresponding commission or discount for paid tickets on 12/15 april 2022 for me experiencing stress caused by staff of amtrak. i got most awful experience on train with my pet because the no clear policy for pets on amtrak websites and regulations and lack of needed training of staff who presents company called amtrak. please consider my complain with fair and i’m gonna be waiting reaching me out amtrak in order to resolve this issue.","['good', 'morning.', 'wanna', 'make', 'complain', 'staff', 'train', 'washington', 'train',

514,trustpilot.com,"On Friday April the 8th 2022, my sister and I rode train #90 [palmetto) from Fayetteville Nc to Richmond Va. What a great ride. The staff was outstanding.  Very professional and courteous. It was my sisters first ride on amtrack. However, I rode the train #89 back from Richmond Va to Fayetteville NC today.  The entire staff was very rude and unprofessional.  Let's start from the beginning,  as I approached the train to board the conductor was rude from the start. He asked me and my husband to step back because he was trying to get people off the train. First of all,  that was not my husband.  It was a perfect stranger. We were both riding alone. I finally get on the train and he tells me I'm in seat 1A. Which at that time I went to my seat and It was taken already,so he put me in another seat. As the train was taking off he moved me once again to the seat with the gentleman he thought was my husband.  After about 10 minutes he came and moved me again to my original seat. The person I was sitting beside in my original seat smelled like octopus.  I turned and put my feet in the isle and put on a extra mask to keep from smelling octopus.  He comes by and tells me to get my feet out of the isle and sit in my seat properly.  I asked if I could please move to another seat. He put me back with the gentleman that he thought was my husband.  To make a long story short,  don't assume. Also, I needed water to take my medication because I'm a diabetic.  I went to the concession cart and was told it was closed. They said they made an announcement,  but no one in my car in business class heard the announcement.  I paid extra to be in business class and I didn't even have a tray in front of me for my laptop. Neither could I plug in my charger because the lady sitting beside me had the plug blocked with all of her belongings.  Also, the gentleman working the food cart was very rude. When I ask him if they had coke or Pepsi his response was what do you see. I said never mind just give me a coffee. Conductor did not help with luggage getting bags on or off. Stated you should only bring what you can handle. Very bad job train #89.I felt I was harrased the entire time.","on friday april the 8th 2022, my sister and i rode train #90 [palmetto) from fayetteville nc to richmond va. what a great ride. the staff was outstanding.  very professional and courteous. it was my sisters first ride on amtrack. however, i rode the train #89 back from richmond va to fayetteville nc today.  the entire staff was very rude and unprofessional.  let's start from the beginning,  as i approached the train to board the conductor was rude from the start. he asked me and my husband to step back because he was trying to get people off the train. first of all,  that was not my husband.  it was a perfect stranger. we were both riding alone. i finally get on the train and he tells me i'm in seat 1a. which at that time i went to my seat and it was taken already,so he put me in another seat. as the train was taking off he moved me once again to the seat with the gentleman he thought was my husband.  after about 10 minutes he came and moved me again to my original seat. the person i was sitting beside in my original seat smelled like octopus.  i turned and put my feet in the isle and put on a extra mask to keep from smelling octopus.  he comes by and tells me to get my feet out of the isle and sit in my seat properly.  i asked if i could please move to another seat. he put me back with the gentleman that he thought was my husband.  to make a long story short,  don't assume. also, i needed water to take my medication because i'm a diabetic.  i went to the concession cart and was told it was closed. they said they made an announcement,  but no one in my car in business class heard the announcement.  i paid extra to be in business class and i didn't even have a tray in front of me for my laptop. neither could i plug in my charger because the lady sitting beside me had the plug blocked with all of her belongings.  also, the gentleman working the food cart was very rude. when i ask him if they had coke or pepsi his response was what do you see. i said never mind just give me a coffee. conductor did not help with luggage getting bags on or off. stated you should only bring what you can handle. very bad job train #89.i felt i was harrased the entire time.","['friday', 'april', '8th', '2022,', 'sister', 'rode', 'train', '#90', '[palmetto)', 'fayetteville', 'nc', 'richmond', 'va.', 'great', 'ride.', 'staff', 'outstanding.', 'professional', 'courteous.', 'sisters', 'first', 'ride', 'amtrack.', 'however,', 'rode', 'train', '#89', 'back', 'richmond', 'va', 'fayetteville', 'nc', 'today.', 'entire', 'staff', 'rude', 'unprofessional.', ""let's"", 'start', 'beginning,', 'approached', 'train', 'board', 'conductor', 'rude', 'start.', 'asked', 'husband', 'step', 'back', 'trying', 'get', 'people', 'train.', 'first', 'all,', 'husband.', 'perfect', 'stranger.', 'riding', 'alone.', 'finally', 'get', 'train', 'tells', ""i'm"", 'seat', '1a.', 'time', 'went', 'seat', 'taken', 'already,so', 'put', 'another', 'seat.', 'train', 'taking', 'moved', 'seat', 'gentleman', 'thought', 'husband.', '10', 'minutes', 'came', 'moved', 'original', 'seat.', 'person', 'sitting', 'beside', 'original', 'seat', 'smelled', 'like', 'octopus.', 'turned', 'put', 'feet', 'isle', 'put', 'extra', 'mask', 'keep', 'smelling', 'octopus.', 'comes', 'tells', 'get', 'feet', 'isle', 'sit', 'seat', 'properly.', 'asked', 'could', 'please', 'move', 'another', 'seat.', 'put', 'back', 'gentleman', 'thought', 'husband.', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short,', 'assume.', 'also,', 'needed', 'water', 'take', 'medication', ""i'm"", 'diabetic.', 'went', 'concession', 'cart', 'told', 'closed.', 'said', 'made', 'announcement,', 'one', 'car', 'business', 'class', 'heard', 'announcement.', 'paid', 'extra', 'business', 'class', 'even', 'tray', 'front', 'laptop.', 'neither', 'could', 'plug', 'charger', 'lady', 'sitting', 'beside', 'plug', 'blocked', 'belongings.', 'also,', 'gentleman', 'working', 'food', 'cart', 'rude.', 'ask', 'coke', 'pepsi', 'response', 'see.', 'said', 'never', 'mind', 'give', 'coffee.', 'conductor', 'help', 'luggage', 'getting', 'bags', 'off.', 'stated', 'bring', 'handle.', 'bad', 'job', 'train', '#89.i', 'felt', 'harrased', 'entire', 'time.']",-0.9102,0.511474359

524,trustpilot.com,"I just filed a claim and I kindly ask that someone get back to me with confirmation that we'll receive some acknowledgement of the mistreatment and unnecessary hardship we experienced on Saturday February 26th, with Amtrak. And also, to reassure me that nobody else will ever go through what we did. All of the details are captured in the case file. In short, my family took the auto train from Lorton to Sanford on Saturday February 19th for our winter vacation (without incident -- it was an excellent experience). On February 26th, our return date, we were told we could not get on the train because our vehicle was too large. HOW COULD THAT BE? They took us down there. For over an hour we begged and insisted we needed to go (we have small children, and had to get home to New York). We were turned away without question, without negotiation, and without any investigation into a solution. And most importantly, without any care or compassion. They told us to go to an auto parts store up the street and have our mirrors removed from the car. That would be the only option. And to leave the lot otherwise. I begged for help.  Literally, my family was stranded in Florida. In the end, we had no choice but to drive 20 hours home to Long Island. Plane tickets weren't an option.We paid for tanks and tanks of gas and put a thousand miles on a brand new vehicle. Paid for a hotel and tolls. Paid the price of exhaustion. Please, I would like for someone to explain to me how Amtrak can bring us down to Florida and then completely strand us there. Without a plan. Without any effort to help us get home.The Customer Care Representative I spoke with, and who helped capture the situation and file the claim for me was very kind and empathetic. I appreciate her very much. That said, I do expect a call from Corporate to confirm receipt of this complaint and acknowledgement that the situation is being recognized for how terrible it is and that the individual that mistreated us and offered no help or solutions will be tended to. Trust me, you really don't want someone like that representing Amtrak.And finally, it would be the right thing for Amtrak to not only offer an apology, but to reimburse our family for all of the unexpected, last minute travel expenses we incurred driving all the way from Florida to eastern Long Island.","i just filed a claim and i kindly ask that someone get back to me with confirmation that we'll receive some acknowledgement of the mistreatment and unnecessary hardship we experienced on saturday february 26th, with amtrak. and also, to reassure me that nobody else will ever go through what we did. all of the details are captured in the case file. in short, my family took the auto train from lorton to sanford on saturday february 19th for our winter vacation (without incident -- it was an excellent experience). on february 26th, our return date, we were told we could not get on the train because our vehicle was too large. how could that be? they took us down there. for over an hour we begged and insisted we needed to go (we have small children, and had to get home to new york). we were turned away without question, without negotiation, and without any investigation into a solution. and most importantly, without any care or compassion. they told us to go to an auto parts store up the street and have our mirrors removed from the car. that would be the only option. and to leave the lot otherwise. i begged for help.  literally, my family was stranded in florida. in the end, we had no choice but to drive 20 hours home to long island. plane tickets weren't an option.we paid for tanks and tanks of gas and put a thousand miles on a brand new vehicle. paid for a hotel and tolls. paid the price of exhaustion. please, i would like for someone to explain to me how amtrak can bring us down to florida and then completely strand us there. without a plan. without any effort to help us get home.the customer care representative i spoke with, and who helped capture the situation and file the claim for me was very kind and empathetic. i appreciate her very much. that said, i do expect a call from corporate to confirm receipt of this complaint and acknowledgement that the situation is being recognized for how terrible it is and that the individual that mistreated us and offered no help or solutions will be tended to. trust me, you really don't want someone like that representing amtrak.and finally, it would be the right thing for amtrak to not only offer an apology, but to reimburse our family for all of the unexpected, last minute travel expenses we incurred driving all the way from florida to eastern long island.","['filed', 'claim', 'kindly', 'ask', 'someone', 'get', 'back', 'confirmation', ""we'll"", 'receive', 'acknowledgement', 'mistreatment', 'unnecessary', 'hardship', 'experienced', 'saturday', 'february', '26th,', 'amtrak.', 'also,', 'reassure', 'nobody', 'else', 'ever', 'go', 'did.', 'details', 'captured', 'case', 'file.', 'short,', 'family', 'took', 'auto', 'train', 'lorton', 'sanford', 'saturday', 'february', '19th', 'winter', 'vacation', '(without', 'incident', '--', 'excellent', 'experience).', 'february', '26th,', 'return', 'date,', 'told', 'could', 'get', 'train', 'vehicle', 'large.', 'could', 'be?', 'took', 'us', 'there.', 'hour', 'begged', 'insisted', 'needed', 'go', '(we', 'small', 'children,', 'get', 'home', 'new', 'york).', 'turned', 'away', 'without', 'question,', 'without', 'negotiation,', 'without', 'investigation', 'solution.', 'importantly,', 'without', 'care', 'compassion.', 'told', 'us', 'go', 'auto', 'parts', 'store', 'street', 'mirrors', 'removed', 'car.', 'would', 'option.', 'leave', 'lot', 'otherwise.', 'begged', 'help.', 'literally,', 'family', 'stranded', 'florida.', 'end,', 'choice', 'drive', '20', 'hours', 'home', 'long', 'island.', 'plane', 'tickets', 'option.we', 'paid', 'tanks', 'tanks', 'gas', 'put', 'thousand', 'miles', 'brand', 'new', 'vehicle.', 'paid', 'hotel', 'tolls.', 'paid', 'price', 'exhaustion.', 'please,', 'would', 'like', 'someone', 'explain', 'amtrak', 'bring', 'us', 'florida', 'completely', 'strand', 'us', 'there.', 'without', 'plan.', 'without', 'effort', 'help', 'us', 'get', 'home.the', 'customer', 'care', 'representative', 'spoke', 'with,', 'helped', 'capture', 'situation', 'file', 'claim', 'kind', 'empathetic.', 'appreciate', 'much.', 'said,', 'expect', 'call', 'corporate', 'confirm', 'receipt', 'complaint', 'acknowledgement', 'situation', 'recognized', 'terrible', 'individual', 'mistreated', 'us', 'offered', 'help', 'solutions', 'tended', 'to.', 'trust', 'me,', 'really', 'want', 'someone', 'like', 'representing', 'amtrak.and', 'finally,', 'would', 'right', 'thing', 'amtrak', 'offer', 'apology,', 'reimburse', 'family', 'unexpected,', 'last', 'minute', 'travel', 'expenses', 'incurred', 'driving', 'way', 'florida', 'eastern', 'long', 'island.']",0.9678,0.555927369

529,trustpilot.com,"Avoid Amtrak at all costs!! I was quite enjoying my trip from Reno to Salt Lake City when the issue of our delay came up. I understand that another train derailing it's not something that could necessarily be controlled by Amtrack. But, the cause of my displeasure is not necessarily the derailment but how it was handled. First off, the intercom said that announcements would not be made until 6 a.m. unless there was an emergency. I think backtracking to Elko and having a 12-14 hour delay is cause for an emergency yet no announcement was made. I was woken by a confused call from my family that I hadn't arrived. When I asked I was told the situation first apathetically and then very defensively from the employees in charge. One employee loudly accused passengers for being ungrateful that we were still alive and raising his voice to tell calm passengers to calm down. The only option for food for coach passengers was to purchase overpriced junk food from the snack bar and a small complementary bag of cheez-its. Given the unexpected and long delay, I think the coach passengers should have been fed in the dining car even though that's not included in their ticket. Or at the very least be offered junk food complimentary more than a small bag of crackers to tide us over for hours. I and several others had people that could pick us up from Elko but we were not allowed to leave the train. I was told this was because we could not block the Elko station but we could have easily pulled up to let people out that wanted out and then go back to the train yard where we had been sitting. I was told aggressively by one of the employees that he would be fired if he let me off the train. When the buses arrived to take us to Salt Lake (8 hours after we were supposed to have arrived at Salt Lake originally), there was only one employee that was authorized to move checked bags so we waited in the buses for over an hour as one person had to personally move every bag to and from the Bus and Train. There were many passengers, including a man and his son that I met on the trip, that decided it was not worth all the delays and wanted to go back the way they had come since the train was going to be going back that way anyways. These passengers were instructed to buy an additional ticket to go back even though they would not be receiving the trip that they paid for in the first place. That is absolutely ludicrous. Not only that but we all were directed towards the customer hotline that was obviously overrun by calls given the situation. But, I had tried to call the same number the day previous before the derailment to extend my ticket to Provo. I was on hold for about 45 minutes before an employee told me to just wait until we got to Salt Lake because no one was ever going to answer. What good is a customer service hotline that everyone is directed to if no one answers even when there's not a crisis? The 45 minutes does not include the 10 minutes that I was shouting at the automated response my confirmation number which it continually got wrong. I was told by repeat customers and employees that to ride the train is to always take a risk especially recently as it sounds like the freight trains are doubling up their trains which are more likely to derail. This was my first train ride and I did not see a warning of this kind anywhere on the website. I even went back and looked and all I found was a Blog about how much better riding a train was than another kind transportation. If these kinds of delays are expected and frequent there should be warning when the ticket is purchased so that customers can make an informed choice. As someone who never rode a train I was almost ridiculed by others that I did not seem to know this. I find Amtrak understaffed, unprepared, and indifferent to the experience of their customers. I will not be repeating this experience again and I have actively been telling all in my acquaintance to avoid Amtrak at all cost. I have been waiting several days to file a complaint on the customer service hotline as I do expect it to be backed up for days given that it is obviously understaffed.","avoid amtrak at all costs!! i was quite enjoying my trip from reno to salt lake city when the issue of our delay came up. i understand that another train derailing it's not something that could necessarily be controlled by amtrack. but, the cause of my displeasure is not necessarily the derailment but how it was handled. first off, the intercom said that announcements would not be made until 6 a.m. unless there was an emergency. i think backtracking to elko and having a 12-14 hour delay is cause for an emergency yet no announcement was made. i was woken by a confused call from my family that i hadn't arrived. when i asked i was told the situation first apathetically and then very defensively from the employees in charge. one employee loudly accused passengers for being ungrateful that we were still alive and raising his voice to tell calm passengers to calm down. the only option for food for coach passengers was to purchase overpriced junk food from the snack bar and a small complementary bag of cheez-its. given the unexpected and long delay, i think the coach passengers should have been fed in the dining car even though that's not included in their ticket. or at the very least be offered junk food complimentary more than a small bag of crackers to tide us over for hours. i and several others had people that could pick us up from elko but we were not allowed to leave the train. i was told this was because we could not block the elko station but we could have easily pulled up to let people out that wanted out and then go back to the train yard where we had been sitting. i was told aggressively by one of the employees that he would be fired if he let me off the train. when the buses arrived to take us to salt lake (8 hours after we were supposed to have arrived at salt lake originally), there was only one employee that was authorized to move checked bags so we waited in the buses for over an hour as one person had to personally move every bag to and from the bus and train. there were many passengers, including a man and his son that i met on the trip, that decided it was not worth all the delays and wanted to go back the way they had come since the train was going to be going back that way anyways. these passengers were instructed to buy an additional ticket to go back even though they would not be receiving the trip that they paid for in the first place. that is absolutely ludicrous. not only that but we all were directed towards the customer hotline that was obviously overrun by calls given the situation. but, i had tried to call the same number the day previous before the derailment to extend my ticket to provo. i was on hold for about 45 minutes before an employee told me to just wait until we got to salt lake because no one was ever going to answer. what good is a customer service hotline that everyone is directed to if no one answers even when there's not a crisis?

532,trustpilot.com,"I recently rode the Amtrak from Tampa to Ft Lauderdale and back (roundtrip) to go on a cruise. the ride going was ok. My beef is that on our return from our cruise which we docked at 7:00am when we get to the Amtrak station around 8:30am We find out that the station doesn’t open until 11:30am. So we were stuck outside the station for 3 hours waiting for them to open. No accessibility to bathrooms.  That is ridiculous.

We were the only ones in the enclosed lounge along with about 5-6 employees. Immediately felt we were not wanted by the employees with looks and facial expressions to each other and us. I started a small conversation here and there with the employees as they rolled their eyes and made small comments under their breath.

He then sat back down. Mind you, he was about 2 feet away from us at his table. So his approach was uncalled for and threatening. The gentleman that was sitting with us apologized and there was no more profanity. At that point, we felt attacked and targeted. So we just kept to ourselves talking. I stood up to get a drink and when I came back I told my husband the time the lounge closed. The rude employee jumped in my conversation and said ""east coast time"" as rude as can be.  My husband was now upset, he turned and said ""your real ignorant"". At that point they all stood up ABRUPTLY, said ""here we go"" and  the employee said to my husband ""the next stop is yours"" it was well known they were just instigating and waiting to abuse some power.

I overheard an Amtrak employee say, “this engine is a piece of garbage.”  Another employee told me the train should never have left Washington, DC…we boarded in Pittsburgh.  I called twice before we left on the trip to be sure I’d have a wheelchair waiting in Union Station to make our connection.  A new engine was hooked on to our train and we finally got into Union Station five hours late where no one was waiting to help me to our connecting train.  Finally a golf cart type vehicle showed up, but we missed our connection!    Amtrak did put us in a hotel in Chicago.  I finally got through to Amtrak Vacations who told me to just go home! Because we missed our connecting train, we lost all of our hotel, tour, and transportation reservations.  We left at midnight on Saturday, October 16, and I was back in Pittsburgh on Monday night, October 18.  The whole train experience was a nightmare.

We were able to travel from New London to DC for a layover that turned into a very chaotic situation. We arrived in DC from New London at 5:45pm scheduled to depart 7:24 going to Savannah GA our final destination. We sat in Union Station from 6:00pm until 8:45pm then we were boarded. However the train never departed the station so we began to worry wondering what’s happening. By now it’s 01/04/2022 at 1:30am and a Conductor finally appears with a Security guard and very rudely says this train isn’t going anywhere tonight, everyone has to get off… without any explanation. This is not an easy task because my mother is 96, one sister is wheelchair bound, the other has Parkinson’s, and my brother has a severe nerve disorder so all the transferring was stressful. It takes us 20mins to get back to the station with our luggage. We spent the night at the station now it’s unsure of what to expect. Later that morning around 6:30am another very rude employee walks through Union Station yelling that no Southbound trains will be leaving the station. That meant another day of cancellations so we had to find accommodations at our own expense with no explanation or consideration from Amtrak. I had to reach out to Amtrak to initiate our return home by calling reservations and holding on the phone for 3 hours! We were finally placed on a train to leave DC on 01/05/2022 however the Conductor let it be known that our boarding was an inconvenience to him and we would have to wait until after everyone boarded before my family could be seated.

I'm so mad right now, I'm reviewing simply to inform people that if you get stuck they likely will not help you and you will be paying out of pocket for unexpected costs if you're stranded somewhere where you have no friends or family.

We were to spend Christmas with my sister in Phoenix, Arizona. So instead of flying to Phoenix, we thought we would take a train to Phoenix, huge mistake. Not only did it cost more than three times the cost of an airline ticket, but it was the most grueling; stressful and trying travel experience we have ever had.It started in Memphis, Tennessee. This is where we boarded the City of New Orleans train bound for Chicago, where we were to make a connection to board the Texas Eagle bound for Phoenix. Well, the City of New Orleans train arrived two hours late. We were to depart Memphis at 9:40 pm but didn’t depart until 11:40 pm. In addition to being late, our bedroom in the sleeper car was the size of a closet. The attendants had stuffed towels between bulkheads to prevent them from rattling. Plus, another warning that I am going to clue you in on, that Amtrak never mentions is, train horn noise! Every time the train enters an intersection where the train intersect a street; road; highway, it will sound its horn for 15 seconds before entering that intersection.  So, the thought that you will be falling to sleep to the clickety-clack of the train moving down the track, is nothing more than an illusion. Now, for another illusion, the great food image aboard a train is just more “smoke & Mirrors” sold to you by Amtrak. Instead of the food promised at a lovely table, we were served microwaved food in either cardboard or plastic container, that was a step below hospital food.

I hoped it wouldn't go nightmare scenario where it's cancelled without refund & I have to drive anyway, or end up stuck somehow. & I [hate] driving.Fortunately, Amtrak is not that low.I had to modify my trip, but because it was so close, I needed an agent. The automated system gave me an estimated wait time of ~1hr & provided a callback option, but I missed it. It only gives 1 opportunity to accept the callback option, & never again throughout the hold time. Seeing other reviews of the customer service line, this may have been relatively fortunate, as they stated that agents could [never] call back.So I waited...for ~3.5hrs...just to get an agent...after the automated system told me it was only a ~1hr wait.Went fairly smoothly. The agent sounded like they were dead inside, but fortunately, they were quick, polite, & weren't rude otherwise.(Continued)The first half of my trip was smooth. Got to my destination at the expected time. Seeing as this was during holidays, the trip was actually shorter than driving would have been. Coach is only slightly more expensive than the gas needed. The reduced stress is a boon & makes up the price difference. Though  considering European & Asian railways... it should be cheaper.On my way back, I was on a, possibly [the], southbound train that was caught by the winter storm on the east coast. This was Jan 3, 2021.I-95 had a super pileup of shipping trucks. So considering that, the train was still leagues better.The snowfall was heavy enough to down trees & block the tracks. We were stuck on the train for almost 24hrs. We had a moment, ~1.5hr, where the train was powered down. So no heat, while it was freezing outside. Fortunately, authorities came to order Amtrak to move us back to our starting locations.Minus 1 star to Amtrak for that, shouldn't have needed to be told.Minus 2 more stars for letting us all be cold. I'd hate to consider how much longer they'd let us steadily freeze had there not been orders from above.We all got transfers at least. No charge. Delay time was 2 days. Train cars were packed from Amtrak trying to catch up.As for blocked railways causing that delay, Amtrak doesn't maintain them. It's not within their scope.Maintaining the railways is mostly under stewardship of CSX (Chessie Seaboard Multiplier).Much like a suburban firebreak, railroads need the tree line cut back to prevent wood debris falling in the way. One prevents your house burning. The other keeps trains running without derailment or other damage & stoppage.During both my away & return trips, I noticed that, for most of the distance, the trees were 5-10 paces away. That's not acceptable.Again, this is a CSX responsibility. [Not] Amtrak.I can't give an Amtrak a minus for that.Good news, the stress was still less than driving, & I got home safe. Would ride again, if only because driving is a -50 stars in my view. Barely a compliment.I recommend airlines if anyone hates trains that much.

Got a roomette because there was no observation car. How is this possible on your most scenic route? I dont want to focus too much on the specific employees of my specific train because clearly with the reviews, it’s a management and systematic issue so consider this a review of the car attendant and not my car attendant.

Never once came by to see if I needed anything or if the meals were wrong. I didnt even bother saying anything because it was such a chore. Forget whether or not I’m a customer and he’s in the hospitality field, he didn’t even treat me like a human. I was a pest. An annoyance. I said thank you after every interaction and he never once said you’re welcome. They act like because they call you sir, that they aren’t insulting you to your face. He just turned his back, grunted, and left. I’d literally rather pay more money to not have a car attendant at all.

612,trustpilot.com,"I'll preface this review by saying that I think most of the issues with Amtrak are the fault of the government and lack of adequate funding. But they sure need to find nicer employees too. The quality of service continues to decline year after year, especially on long-distance trains. Maybe the service on the northeast corridor trains is great; I have seldom traveled on those. I get the feeling that the long-distance routes subsidize the northeast corridor trains, which if true, is so unfair. It seems like the D.C. based federal government (politicians and employees) wants to get rid of the national Amtrak network and just have their fancy new high-speed trains for their convenience in the northeast.I've taken many trips on Amtrak over the years, both short and cross country. Unless you're a train nut and/or hate/afraid of flying, do not use Amtrak. There are a few good/nice Amtrak employees, but most are surly, unprofessional, or downright mean. The bad experience starts with their website. It's impossible to plan a multi-stop, long-distance trip on the website. So, unfortunately one must get a reservations agent on the phone, which takes FOREVER. When one finally answers, they are very rude and impatient. I've even been scolded because I didn't understand their wacky website. IF you pursue this misadventure further and actually board a train, you'll most likely be riding on ancient passenger cars staffed by yet more angry, bitter, unprofessional, surly, and power-mad employees. The passenger cars' HVAC systems are ancient as well and can't make use of HEPA filters (to rid the air of covid). Mask wearing is enforced only sporadically. None of the windows open (not even an inch), even in the private rooms. The food is HORRIBLE and is served on/in plastic which is NOT biodegradable I'd bet. There are frequent disruptions and late trains. I and my friends have experienced waits ranging from three to 20+ hours! And Amtrak does not keep you informed about these disruptions. You'll be sitting there (sometimes literally) in the dark in some remote area with no bathroom or anything to eat or drink. To sum up, Amtrak is only a good idea for rail fans and people who don't fly and MUST get someplace and can't drive.","i'll preface this review by saying that i think most of the issues with amtrak are the fault of the government and lack of adequate funding. but they sure need to find nicer employees too. the quality of service continues to decline year after year, especially on long-distance trains. maybe the service on the northeast corridor trains is great; i have seldom traveled on those. i get the feeling that the long-distance routes subsidize the northeast corridor trains, which if true, is so unfair. it seems like the d.c. based federal government (politicians and employees) wants to get rid of the national amtrak network and just have their fancy new high-speed trains for their convenience in the northeast.i've taken many trips on amtrak over the years, both short and cross country. unless you're a train nut and/or hate/afraid of flying, do not use amtrak. there are a few good/nice amtrak employees, but most are surly, unprofessional, or downright mean. the bad experience starts with their website. it's impossible to plan a multi-stop, long-distance trip on the website. so, unfortunately one must get a reservations agent on the phone, which takes forever. when one finally answers, they are very rude and impatient. i've even been scolded because i didn't understand their wacky website. if you pursue this misadventure further and actually board a train, you'll most likely be riding on ancient passenger cars staffed by yet more angry, bitter, unprofessional, surly, and power-mad employees. the passenger cars' hvac systems are ancient as well and can't make use of hepa filters (to rid the air of covid). mask wearing is enforced only sporadically. none of the windows open (not even an inch), even in the private rooms. the food is horrible and is served on/in plastic which is not biodegradable i'd bet. there are frequent disruptions and late trains. i and my friends have experienced waits ranging from three to 20+ hours! and amtrak does not keep you informed about these disruptions. you'll be sitting there (sometimes literally) in the dark in some remote area with no bathroom or anything to eat or drink. to sum up, amtrak is only a good idea for rail fans and people who don't fly and must get someplace and can't drive.","[""i'll"", 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'think', 'issues', 'amtrak', 'fault', 'government', 'lack', 'adequate', 'funding.', 'sure', 'need', 'find', 'nicer', 'employees', 'too.', 'quality', 'service', 'continues', 'decline', 'year', 'year,', 'especially', 'long-distance', 'trains.', 'maybe', 'service', 'northeast', 'corridor', 'trains', 'great;', 'seldom', 'traveled', 'those.', 'get', 'feeling', 'long-distance', 'routes', 'subsidize', 'northeast', 'corridor', 'trains,', 'true,', 'unfair.', 'seems', 'like', 'd.c.', 'based', 'federal', 'government', '(politicians', 'employees)', 'wants', 'get', 'rid', 'national', 'amtrak', 'network', 'fancy', 'new', 'high-speed', 'trains', 'convenience', ""northeast.i've"", 'taken', 'many', 'trips', 'amtrak', 'years,', 'short', 'cross', 'country.', 'unless', 'train', 'nut', 'and/or', 'hate/afraid', 'flying,', 'use', 'amtrak.', 'good/nice', 'amtrak', 'employees,', 'surly,', 'unprofessional,', 'downright', 'mean.', 'bad', 'experience', 'starts', 'website.', 'impossible', 'plan', 'multi-stop,', 'long-distance', 'trip', 'website.', 'so,', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'must', 'get', 'reservations', 'agent', 'phone,', 'takes', 'forever.', 'one', 'finally', 'answers,', 'rude', 'impatient.', ""i've"", 'even', 'scolded', 'understand', 'wacky', 'website.', 'pursue', 'misadventure', 'actually', 'board', 'train,', 'likely', 'riding', 'ancient', 'passenger', 'cars', 'staffed', 'yet', 'angry,', 'bitter,', 'unprofessional,', 'surly,', 'power-mad', 'employees.', 'passenger', ""cars'"", 'hvac', 'systems', 'ancient', 'well', ""can't"", 'make', 'use', 'hepa', 'filters', '(to', 'rid', 'air', 'covid).', 'mask', 'wearing', 'enforced', 'sporadically.', 'none', 'windows', 'open', '(not', 'even', 'inch),', 'even', 'private', 'rooms.', 'food', 'horrible', 'served', 'on/in', 'plastic', 'biodegradable', ""i'd"", 'bet.', 'frequent', 'disruptions', 'late', 'trains.', 'friends', 'experienced', 'waits', 'ranging', 'three', '20+', 'hours!', 'amtrak', 'keep', 'informed', 'disruptions.', 'sitting', '(sometimes', 'literally)', 'dark', 'remote', 'area', 'bathroom', 'anything', 'eat', 'drink.', 'sum', 'up,', 'amtrak', 'good', 'idea', 'rail', 'fans', 'people', 'fly', 'must', 'get', 'someplace', ""can't"", 'drive.']",-0.9778,0.633803277

632,trustpilot.com,"There were six of us from Indy, traveling Amtrak from Chicago to Glacier National Park. We purchased our vacation from Amtrak vacations, who is not owned by Amtrak. The Chicago culture is not as friendly as most places, but the Amtrak people in Chi-town were just downright mean and had some serious control issues. UP AGAINST THE WALL, one man spitting his words to several of us in line pointing, so a slow moving cart could come around the corner. The woman in the Metro Lounge was just as nasty, not so much as giving their guests eye contact. Spouting the rules and regs to park your luggage in the undersized closet. By God you aren’t getting your luggage back if you don't have your green ticket. Every single Union station worker was on this power trip. One of our six is a petite 55 year old woman who asked for help with her bag to get onto the train 1000’ down the track. By the time the conversation was over, she was in tears. Less hassle than the airlines? I think not. Once we were on the train, the 🧑‍✈️ was very welcoming and helpful. The car and roomette was worn and grimy but oh well at least we felt welcome. It wasn’t long before the subject of meals came up. The 👩‍✈️ ask if we want 5pm or 6:45. We chose the later and finally by 9pm they allowed us in the dining car. The meal was as good as train food can be and the folks serving it up worked hard. I assume they were short handed because this is what they repeatedly told us on the way out and back.  The 👩‍✈️ Made up our beds for us (dont forget to tip) and I slept in the upper while my wife had the lower. Not the best night sleep I ever had, its a train…but at 3am I awoke with 16 bed bug bites. My buddy across the hall had two. My RN wife and buddy didn’t believe me that it was bedbugs. Two days later in Glacier we met a Nurse Practioner who had the same problem and went to an after hours clinic. They confirmed it was indeed bed bugs. Yikes! Hey, it happens, right? I bet it would happen less if they would vacuum and clean. I notified the conductor  and as he shook his head in a not again sort of way, assured me that the car would be taken out of service and fumigated. Not sure if that included cleaning. The conductor handed me an incident report and gave me a look like don’t let the door hit you on the butt. The fine people from all over the US working the short summer at the park were well trained and downright helpful in every way. With every problem a response was heard from them, you are with Amtrak vacations? They knew of their shortcoming and the work arounds to fix them.I wont go into all of the screw-ups that this disorganized company made, but there were plenty including over charging and canceling excursions at the last minute. Want to talk with someone on the phone. Get ready to sit for an hour and wait.The trip out thru the plains was mildly interesting if you are the sort of person who can find beauty in anything. The trip back was the same in reverse. Then return to the cow lines in Union Station with their dogs barking at our heals. When people ask how my trip was I ask them if they remember the Chevy Chase vacation movies? Oh, one more thing, a week or two after retuning home a fat letter came from Amtrak. At last an apology or maybe 10% off a ticket or two. Nope, a letter stating if you want to make a claim (reimbusrement for medical) fill out these 80 forms and be sure to give us you SS#, insurance company name, sign this disclaimer etc, Yeah, I’m goin‘ do that.","there were six of us from indy, traveling amtrak from chicago to glacier national park. we purchased our vacation from amtrak vacations, who is not owned by amtrak. the chicago culture is not as friendly as most places, but the amtrak people in chi-town were just downright mean and had some serious control issues. up against the wall, one man spitting his words to several of us in line pointing, so a slow moving cart could come around the corner. the woman in the metro lounge was just as nasty, not so much as giving their guests eye contact. spouting the rules and regs to park your luggage in the undersized closet. by god you aren’t getting your luggage back if you don't have your green ticket. every single union station worker was on this power trip. one of our six is a petite 55 year old woman who asked for help with her bag to get onto the train 1000’ down the track. by the time the conversation was over, she was in tears. less hassle than the airlines?

684,trustpilot.com,"By far my worst experience ever especially being it my first time riding with Amtrak. I found myself kind of being stuck in Reston, VA as I was seeking last minute flights back to Florida. Tix were so expensive ($200-$300) for a one way, so I was trying different alternatives for finding a way back home. I discovered that Amtrak station was not far from where I was currently staying with a friend. I booked the tix at $155 one-way to Ftl thinking I could relax, read, and finish up with work. Boy was I in for a rude awakening! Everything was smooth until the train took off. I had my own mask and was minding my own business until a staff collecting tix stopped in my area. He asked me where I was headed and told him Fort Lauderdale. He then asked me to adjust my mask so that it covered my nose, in which I did. Assumed he did not like my mask, he pulled out an extra one and told me to put that mask on in which I did. 30 mins later same dude walks by and ask me to pull up my mask. I looked at him and said, ""Sir my mask is on, what more do you want?"" He claimed it wasn't over my nose enough. In my head, I'm thinking ""Is this dude serious??!!"" In any case, I pulled my mask up and continued doing what I was doing (reading and listening to music). Then like 40-45 mins later same dude comes BACK around (mind you its like 10/11pm) and stops in my area. He asked again for me to adjust my mask. I had to stop and think for a moment and really ask myself, ""Is this dude just going to harass me the whole time about how to ""properly"" where this damn mask? Keep in mind barely no one was on the train. I clearly was abiding by the six feet social distancing rule and my mask was on. So I said to him, ""Sir, not sure exactly how you want me to wear this mask you gave me because I believe I am wearing it properly but if you would like me to wear tape to properly hold up my mask over my whole nose you can definitely bring some so I can gladly adjust to your liking"". He must've got pissed because he comes back with his supervisor. His supervisor now asks me what the issue is in which I let her know I didn't think there was one. She mentioned its Amtrak policy to cover all of nose and mouth with mask. I tell her that is what I am doing, but keep in mind people do have to eat and drink and when this happens the mask cannot be on my face. I also asked her to bring me tape and if this would satisfy her staff from harassing me especially that I am a paying customer. She returns with the police, Wow!!! I was asleep as it was past midnight and I wake up to lights being shined in my face. I get escorted off the train in a town I never heard of before and when I get inside the station they tell me the next train isn't until the next day at night and I would have to buy another ticket. Are you f#$%^ kidding me???!!! I call customer service and they refused to issue a refund. What an experience!!!! Not sure if I should blame China covid or Amtrak because as a first time passenger on this train, they definitely treated me and a few others as if we were not paying customers and disregarded us off their train in the middle of nowhere as if we hopped on for free. Even the cops who escorted myself & others off the train was in shock when he found out that we got kicked off over a mask!!!! Though this event just happened, I most certainly will be fighting Amtrak and disputing w/my credit card on this $155 transaction. Not only is Amtrak refusing to even give me partial refund, they threw numerous ppl off in the middle of the early morning in the middle of only god knows where.I am not familiar with Rocky Moutains, NC at all! Leaving us with no stay or alternative transportation. One of the people who also got kicked off was a parent with a small child. They were not open nor willing to work out something with us on perhaps catching another train or even helping to accommodate us on stay. As a result of this matter, I would never again get on an Amtrak train and I will see to it that I post this review on as many sites and social media platforms so that people can see how unethical Amtrak is to their customers. I am still awaiting for corporate to get back to me on this matter.

everything was smooth until the train took off. i had my own mask and was minding my own business until a staff collecting tix stopped in my area. he asked me where i was headed and told him fort lauderdale. he then asked me to adjust my mask so that it covered my nose, in which i did. assumed he did not like my mask, he pulled out an extra one and told me to put that mask on in which i did. 30 mins later same dude walks by and ask me to pull up my mask. i looked at him and said, ""sir my mask is on, what more do you want?"" he claimed it wasn't over my nose enough. in my head, i'm thinking ""is this dude serious??!!"" in any case, i pulled my mask up and continued doing what i was doing (reading and listening to music). then like 40-45 mins later same dude comes back around (mind you its like 10/11pm) and stops in my area. he asked again for me to adjust my mask. i had to stop and think for a moment and really ask myself, ""is this dude just going to harass me the whole time about how to ""properly"" where this damn mask? keep in mind barely no one was on the train. i clearly was abiding by the six feet social distancing rule and my mask was on. so i said to him, ""sir, not sure exactly how you want me to wear this mask you gave me because i believe i am wearing it properly but if you would like me to wear tape to properly hold up my mask over my whole nose you can definitely bring some so i can gladly adjust to your liking"". he must've got pissed because he comes back with his supervisor. his supervisor now asks me what the issue is in which i let her know i didn't think there was one. she mentioned its amtrak policy to cover all of nose and mouth with mask. i tell her that is what i am doing, but keep in mind people do have to eat and drink and when this happens the mask cannot be on my face. i also asked her to bring me tape and if this would satisfy her staff from harassing me especially that i am a paying customer. she returns with the police, wow!!! i was asleep as it was past midnight and i wake up to lights being shined in my face. i get escorted off the train in a town i never heard of before and when i get inside the station they tell me the next train isn't until the next day at night and i would have to buy another ticket. are you f#$%^ kidding me???!!! i call customer service and they refused to issue a refund. what an experience!!!! not sure if i should blame china covid or amtrak because as a first time passenger on this train, they definitely treated me and a few others as if we were not paying customers and disregarded us off their train in the middle of nowhere as if we hopped on for free. even the cops who escorted myself & others off the train was in shock when he found out that we got kicked off over a mask!!!! though this event just happened, i most certainly will be fighting amtrak and disputing w/my credit card on this $155 transaction. not only is amtrak refusing to even give me partial refund, they threw numerous ppl off in the middle of the early morning in the middle of only god knows where.i am not familiar with rocky moutains, nc at all! leaving us with no stay or alternative transportation. one of the people who also got kicked off was a parent with a small child. they were not open nor willing to work out something with us on perhaps catching another train or even helping to accommodate us on stay. as a result of this matter, i would never again get on an amtrak train and i will see to it that i post this review on as many sites and social media platforms so that people can see how unethical amtrak is to their customers. i am still awaiting for corporate to get back to me on this matter. reserve#24dcfc case#5730234","['far', 'worst', 'experience', 'ever', 'especially', 'first', 'time', 'riding', 'amtrak.', 'found', 'kind', 'stuck', 'reston,', 'va', 'seeking', 'last', 'minute', 'flights', 'back', 'florida.', 'tix', 'expensive', '($200-$300)', 'one', 'way,', 'trying', 'different', 'alternatives', 'finding', 'way', 'back', 'home.', 'discovered', 'amtrak', 'station', 'far', 'currently', 'staying', 'friend.', 'booked', 'tix', '$155', 'one-way', 'ftl', 'thinking', 'could', 'relax,', 'read,', 'finish', 'work.', 'boy', 'rude', 'awakening!', 'everything', 'smooth', 'train', 'took', 'off.', 'mask', 'minding', 'business', 'staff', 'collecting', 'tix', 'stopped', 'area.', 'asked', 'headed', 'told', 'fort', 'lauderdale.', 'asked', 'adjust', 'mask', 'covered', 'nose,', 'did.', 'assumed', 'like', 'mask,', 'pulled', 'extra', 'one', 'told', 'put', 'mask', 'did.', '30', 'mins', 'later', 'dude', 'walks', 'ask', 'pull', 'mask.', 'looked', 'said,', '""sir', 'mask', 'on,', 'want?""', 'claimed', 'nose', 'enough.', 'head,', ""i'm"", 'thinking', '""is', 'dude', 'serious??!!""', 'case,', 'pulled', 'mask', 'continued', '(reading', 'listening', 'music).', 'like', '40-45', 'mins', 'later', 'dude', 'comes', 'back', 'around', '(mind', 'like', '10/11pm)', 'stops', 'area.', 'asked', 'adjust', 'mask.', 'stop', 'think', 'moment', 'really', 'ask', 'myself,', '""is', 'dude', 'going', 'harass', 'whole', 'time', '""properly""', 'damn', 'mask?', 'keep', 'mind', 'barely', 'one', 'train.', 'clearly', 'abiding', 'six', 'feet', 'social', 'distancing', 'rule', 'mask', 'on.', 'said', 'him,', '""sir,', 'sure', 'exactly', 'want', 'wear', 'mask', 'gave', 'believe', 'wearing', 'properly', 'would', 'like', 'wear', 'tape', 'properly', 'hold', 'mask', 'whole', 'nose', 'definitely', 'bring', 'gladly', 'adjust', 'liking"".', ""must've"", 'got', 'pissed', 'comes', 'back', 'supervisor.', 'supervisor', 'asks', 'issue', 'let', 'know', 'think', 'one.', 'mentioned', 'amtrak', 'policy', 'cover', 'nose', 'mouth', 'mask.', 'tell', 'doing,', 'keep', 'mind', 'people', 'eat', 'drink', 'happens', 'mask', 'cannot', 'face.', 'also', 'asked', 'bring', 'tape', 'would', 'satisfy', 'staff', 'harassing', 'especially', 'paying', 'customer.', 'returns', 'police,', 'wow!!!', 'asleep', 'past', 'midnight', 'wake', 'lights', 'shined', 'face.', 'get', 'escorted', 'train', 'town', 'never', 'heard', 'get', 'inside', 'station', 'tell', 'next', 'train', 'next', 'day', 'night', 'would', 'buy', 'another', 'ticket.', 'f#$%^', 'kidding', 'me???!!!', 'call', 'customer', 'service', 'refused', 'issue', 'refund.', 'experience!!!!', 'sure', 'blame', 'china', 'covid', 'amtrak', 'first', 'time', 'passenger', 'train,', 'definitely', 'treated', 'others', 'paying', 'customers', 'disregarded', 'us', 'train', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'hopped', 'free.', 'even', 'cops', 'escorted', '&', 'others', 'train', 'shock', 'found', 'got', 'kicked', 'mask!!!!', 'though', 'event', 'happened,', 'certainly', 'fighting', 'amtrak', 'disputing', 'w/my', 'credit', 'card', '$155', 'transaction.', 'amtrak', 'refusing', 'even', 'give', 'partial', 'refund,', 'threw', 'numerous', 'ppl', 'middle', 'early', 'morning', 'middle', 'god', 'knows', 'where.i', 'familiar', 'rocky', 'moutains,', 'nc', 'all!', 'leaving', 'us', 'stay', 'alternative', 'transportation.', 'one', 'people', 'also', 'got', 'kicked', 'parent', 'small', 'child.', 'open', 'willing', 'work', 'something', 'us', 'perhaps', 'catching', 'another', 'train', 'even', 'helping', 'accommodate', 'us', 'stay.', 'result', 'matter,', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'amtrak', 'train', 'see', 'post', 'review', 'many', 'sites', 'social', 'media', 'platforms', 'people', 'see', 'unethical', 'amtrak', 'customers.', 'still', 'awaiting', 'corporate', 'get', 'back', 'matter.', 'reserve#24dcfc', 'case#5730234']",-0.8167,0.430380486

The stewards on the train both ways were excellent. We took the Amtrak autotrain in November 2020. I called and changed my reservation to come back home a day earlier due to a family emergency. Three hours into the trip the train broke down. They gave us no information on the train as to why we were stopped or how long it will take. We should of arrived in Virginia at 8:30 am but instead arrived at 5:00 pm. 8 1/2 hours later and right into the heart of rush hour traffic getting home. My 4 hour drive turned into a 6 hour drive. I contacted Amtrak the next day because I definitely feel we should of gotten some form of compensation for the extra 10 hours of my life that I’ll never get back. They responded immediately with an email saying they would look into it and get back to me within 30-60 days.

698,trustpilot.com,"We travelled in train # 6 from Nebraska to Illinois. The train was 1 hour late, so it went faster tokeep on schedule. I did not enjoy it. Previously, train had gone smoothly. Another was that there were more passangers and I thought that they would put seats farther apart due to COVID 19. In fact, there were far more passangers in this trip than other we took last year. This is probably die to the fact that trains do not run every day, but 3 times a week only.

A lady I did not know how do you use her credit card to pay for my luggage check and I gave her the money. Thank God a stranger was there to help me because your company was no help at all. Sono I am sitting in the streets of Cleveland with all my carry-on luggage because the Amtrak station closes it doesn't open till midnight so now I'm sitting in the middle of Cleveland where I know no one and have nowhere to go and I'm sitting on the streets after $800 Amtrak ticket. This is the absolute worst travel and experience I have had between uninformed mative information of the riots and how to deal with it to the nobody told me cash only or a credit cards only and leave me stuck here in the city where I know no one and have nowhere to go and I haven't even made it on the train yet I mean what is going to be my experience getting on the train because it has been horrible so far horrible all I want to do is go home and you're making it almost impossible and just keep taking my money. I couldn't even sit in the parking lot and wait for the train station the open they literally made me leave the ground with all of my carry-on luggage and go into the streets of Cleveland where I know no one and have nowhere to go. If this is how you treat your customers that pay well to travel well I hate to see how you treat your customers that buy the lower rate tickets it must be horrible because your policies almost make it impossible to travel and make it a very difficult experience. Which is not what you want after dropping so much money to move the Florida and using Amtrak cuz it was recommended because of the shipping fees were supposed to be lower and here I am having my stuff is with a stranger and I don't know I gave it away she's supposed to mail me a couple of boxes back I don't know if she will who knows she just made out if she didn't. And I'm stuck here all day until midnight when the train station opens again and the streets of Cleveland like a homeless person after paid $800 for all my check baggage . I am at a loss of words and your company is really needs to go over their policies because you made my travel and experience terrible I've cried several times this is a nightmare all I want to do is go home and here I am on the streets like a homeless person with all my carry-on luggage wondering how I'm going to make it back to the strain tasting at midnight because I've already paid $40 for a ride from Lodi to Cleveland to catch my train last nighr. this is how you treat your customers you throw them out of the streets like a homeless person while they're waiting on a train that you forced the person to miss because you would not take her cash. you really need to review your company policies and talk to your employees of how to handle them a little bit better when you're telling someone they have to give up more of what they own and they don't like you and they only take a credit card and they won't take your money and they have no other advice for you and they tell you nothing.

price for the shipping was way off from what the lady told me beforehand like a buy $100 o they do not take cash right now so there was no way for me to pay because all i had was cash. a lady i did not know how do you use her credit card to pay for my luggage check and i gave her the money. thank god a stranger was there to help me because your company was no help at all. sono i am sitting in the streets of cleveland with all my carry-on luggage because the amtrak station closes it doesn't open till midnight so now i'm sitting in the middle of cleveland where i know no one and have nowhere to go and i'm sitting on the streets after $800 amtrak ticket. this is the absolute worst travel and experience i have had between uninformed mative information of the riots and how to deal with it to the nobody told me cash only or a credit cards only and leave me stuck here in the city where i know no one and have nowhere to go and i haven't even made it on the train yet i mean what is going to be my experience getting on the train because it has been horrible so far horrible all i want to do is go home and you're making it almost impossible and just keep taking my money. i couldn't even sit in the parking lot and wait for the train station the open they literally made me leave the ground with all of my carry-on luggage and go into the streets of cleveland where i know no one and have nowhere to go. if this is how you treat your customers that pay well to travel well i hate to see how you treat your customers that buy the lower rate tickets it must be horrible because your policies almost make it impossible to travel and make it a very difficult experience. which is not what you want after dropping so much money to move the florida and using amtrak cuz it was recommended because of the shipping fees were supposed to be lower and here i am having my stuff is with a stranger and i don't know i gave it away she's supposed to mail me a couple of boxes back i don't know if she will who knows she just made out if she didn't. and i'm stuck here all day until midnight when the train station opens again and the streets of cleveland like a homeless person after paid $800 for all my check baggage . i am at a loss of words and your company is really needs to go over their policies because you made my travel and experience terrible i've cried several times this is a nightmare all i want to do is go home and here i am on the streets like a homeless person with all my carry-on luggage wondering how i'm going to make it back to the strain tasting at midnight because i've already paid $40 for a ride from lodi to cleveland to catch my train last nighr. this is how you treat your customers you throw them out of the streets like a homeless person while they're waiting on a train that you forced the person to miss because you would not take her cash. you really need to review your company policies and talk to your employees of how to handle them a little bit better when you're telling someone they have to give up more of what they own and they don't like you and they only take a credit card and they won't take your money and they have no other advice for you and they tell you nothing. amtrak is horrible i will never travel aga,"['first', 'city', 'closed', 'riots', 'could', 'give', 'information', 'told', 'try', 'go', 'national', 'guard', 'get', 'train.',

726,trustpilot.com,I love traveling on Amtrak and have been on nearly every route over the years. My first trip I packed a book but I was so busy enjoying the scenery that I never really read it. Since Amtrak doesn't own the rails they travel on I always allow for them to be majorly late if they get hung up by freight traffic. I always feel safer traveling by train. It's too bad that they don't get adequate funding by Congress. They have to constantly make cuts year after year to try to become profitable but don't think any national railroad in the world is profitable. That's why Amtrak was formed- the freights got out of the passenger business because they were losing money. After 9/11 Amtrak and the bus was the only way to travel and I wish Congress wouldn't forget this. The lack of funding has had a bad effect on the food service and of course the equipment is way too old.,i love traveling on amtrak and have been on nearly every route over the years. my first trip i packed a book but i was so busy enjoying the scenery that i never really read it. since amtrak doesn't own the rails they travel on i always allow for them to be majorly late if they get hung up by freight traffic. i always feel safer traveling by train. it's too bad that they don't get adequate funding by congress. they have to constantly make cuts year after year to try to become profitable but don't think any national railroad in the world is profitable. that's why amtrak was formed- the freights got out of the passenger business because they were losing money. after 9/11 amtrak and the bus was the only way to travel and i wish congress wouldn't forget this. the lack of funding has had a bad effect on the food service and of course the equipment is way too old.,"['love', 'traveling', 'amtrak', 'nearly', 'every', 'route', 'years.', 'first', 'trip', 'packed', 'book', 'busy', 'enjoying', 'scenery', 'never', 'really', 'read', 'it.', 'since', 'amtrak', 'rails', 'travel', 'always', 'allow', 'majorly', 'late', 'get', 'hung', 'freight', 'traffic.', 'always', 'feel', 'safer', 'traveling', 'train.', 'bad', 'get', 'adequate', 'funding', 'congress.', 'constantly', 'make', 'cuts', 'year', 'year', 'try', 'become', 'profitable', 'think', 'national', 'railroad', 'world', 'profitable.', ""that's"", 'amtrak', 'formed-', 'freights', 'got', 'passenger', 'business', 'losing', 'money.', '9/11', 'amtrak', 'bus', 'way', 'travel', 'wish', 'congress', 'forget', 'this.', 'lack', 'funding', 'bad', 'effect', 'food', 'service', 'course', 'equipment', 'way', 'old.']",0.7405,0.516666667

728,trustpilot.com,I purchased an Amtrack ticket from Philadelphia to west palm beach. We used a Amtrack employee to book our trip . The employee did not tell us that there were two trains one that stops in Tampa out of the way and another that does not stop in Tampa. The one I took  stopped in Tampa . When it stopped in Washington DC instead of picking up the extra engine  which was protocol according to the staff on the train it only picked up one engine . This engine broke down in Virginia for over 6 hours. The conductor told me that two of those hours were spent figuring out what to do . They should have a plan in place .  They didn’t infirm us exactly our new time of arrival .to our destination.  They had one attendant on the train for food and he took breaks close to meal times for the  food car . So everyone had to stand in a long line to purchase food and drink. Which involved you be subjected to the coach people who were drunk half of them.  Not behaving . The food service   Train was taken away so your stuck for over 24 hours eating garbage like hot dogs . They should have separate food for sleeper cars like they do  for the  auto train. People don’t eat garbage food like that they want healthy food salads and fresh fruit . I luckily packed my own food  I had read a review about the food before leaving. Then it happened the last 8 hours  the smell of poop coming thru the vents . I find out in coach all the toilets were over flowing and it was a hot mess in the coach car . They should of been cleaned at one of the stops . I was lucky I had a sleeper bed room  with my own bath room. Which I locked and drew the curtains for my safety . The attendant was non existent and told me not to wake her in the morning because she sleeps late . Apparently she didn’t sleep enough because she was tired and should of been relieved from her job . Amtrack could have done something for the sleeper people moved us to a bus in Orlando so that we could of had our  vacation day back . Nope they carried us all to Tampa and we had no idea we were even going to Tampa most of us were not informed. So that we got in at 11:40 instead of four in the afternoon .  I won’t get on a smelly gross Amtrack long distance ever again !!! The service was awful and the people scary and the train smells like bowl movements. They can’t handle a engine failure . They don’t make it right . They could help you get off the train and find alternative transportation so you don’t loose your car rental and  Destroy your vacation . Never ever will I go any further then four hours with Amtrak Fly don’t train it ! Rent a car drive down it’s much faster then getting in the train to Florida. Amtrak should not be allowed to travel over night and not provide descent meals. Airplanes provide meals when it’s overnight . How can you have people waiting in long lines at meal times buying hot dogs for two days . It’s nuts. You lost your charm taking away the dinning car. Your only a a moving  bathroom on wheels on a track being pulled by broken down rusty engine cars . No one should have to smell poop for eight hours . Fly people fly !!!  A refund wouldn’t even be pay back for this.

806,complaintsboard.com,"On the morning of 09/30/22, I was to catch the early train from Topeka and was notified via email it was running a little late. I called Amtrak customer service and got a rude/nasty girl who kept telling me the arrival in Topeka would be two hours late. All I wanted to know is if I would make my connection in Kansas City (Missouri River Runner) in time. She proclaimed ""I don't know what you want me to say - it's going to be 2 hours late"". I explained to her that the app said it was only 1 hour and 31 minutes late. She hatefully said ""nope, it's 2 hours late"". I hung up the phone then redialed the customer service number and got a nice young man who couldn't tell me a different answer...except that it was 2 hours late - but, he was nice. The app on my phone, however, said it would be 1 hour (now) 39 minutes late arriving in Topeka but only 55 minutes late arriving in Kansas City. He had no answer for that confusion...but, after his recommendation of canceling the two separate Kansas City and the Topeka trips and then rebooking them together, I did that and felt confident that I would make the River Runner in time since it was only 55 minutes late into KC. The train made up time and were assured over the train intercom ""not to worry, we would definitely make our connection"". We pulled into Union Station right alongside the train we were to transfer to, the Missouri River Runner. I was excited to know I would soon be on the next leg of my trip and on time. Soon after the announcement about us making the connection, we heard that we should all remain seated as they were going to hook up two more cars for the next leg of that particular trains trip. Then, as the train was not moving, we were told we were sitting there waiting on a cargo train to pass. That lasted about 10 minutes. Then we began to go in reverse. We hooked up one of the extra passenger cars...then the other. As the second car was being attached, the Missouri River Runner began to pull away from the station. Oh No! They left without me. Frustrated and one of the first people off the train, I spoke to an employee and said I missed my train (yes, it was literally just yards away from where I stood moving away quickly). He said, yes, we know there were several of you who were to board that train. I asked why we couldn't get off to get on that train. He said because it was not safe. I understand that, but we sat for 10 minutes waiting for a cargo train and we could have gotten off and been on the River Runner before it departed. He told me they radioed the River Runner and told them the situation then asked them to wait 10 minutes to which they were told ""No"". We had to be rebooked on the next train that left 8 hours later thus we had to hang around the station all day long to board our train. I missed a meeting, a visit/lunch with a friend, and had to rearrange a pick up in St. Louis for that night. There is also the matter that I booked Business Class on the AM train and there were no Business Class seats on the PM train. This frustrating day did not need to happen for us. These are just not good practices and I feel I should be compensated in some way for the poor decisions of Amtrak representatives that day. This makes me furious.

The terrible experience I had was when I was traveling to Pittsburgh, PA on August 8, 2022. The train was scheduled to be in Huntingdon, PA at 4:23 pm. It was not on time. It was closed to 4:45 pm when it arrived. In addition to this, they were no seats for me to sit on in the train. I had to walk from one Train car to another with the White male Conductor following me behind all the way to the last car like as if I was a Criminal because I am an African American woman with long hair. He harassed me for my Train ticket to scan it while I was standing with a heavy luggage, a Tote bag, and shopping bag. He was very inconsiderate. I had to stand from the time I entered the Train in Huntingdon, PA till the Train stopped at Atloona, PA for people to get off. The seat that I found was dirty and had food stains on it. I had to use my Hand Sanitizer and Face Tissue to wipe down the seat before sitting down.

Usually, when a Passenger enters the Train, the Conductor that collects or scans tickets, waits untill the Passenger is settled down in his/her seat or found a comfortable spot to stand before asking for Train ticket. This White man following behind all the way is unacceptable and disrespectful. I purchased my Train tickets and paid for them in full.

usually, when a passenger enters the train, the conductor that collects or scans tickets, waits untill the passenger is settled down in his/her seat or found a comfortable spot to stand before asking for train ticket. this white man following behind all the way is unacceptable and disrespectful. i purchased my train tickets and paid for them in full. why should i be harrassed by a white man in the train because i am a woman? i called several times last saturday, august 20, 2022 and i was transferred to a called by service and i was hung up on. i had to call back again, only to be told that the customer relations doesn't open on saturdays. that i should call back from monday to friday from 8 am to 8 pm. i called today august 22, 2022, using the called back service. i was hung up on. i called back again and decided to hold. i was holding on the phone for 34 minutes and 53 seconds before i got a response and was transffered to customer relations. i held for 1 hour, 9 minutes, and 24 seconds. nobody picked up the phone.","['purchased', 'amtrak', 'train', 'tickets', 'july', '9,', '2022,', 'traveling', 'pittsburgh', 'august', '8,', '2022', 'returning', 'back', 'pittsburgh', 'august', '19,', '2022.', 'terrible', 'experience', 'traveling', 'pittsburgh,', 'pa', 'august', '8,', '2022.', 'train', 'scheduled', 'huntingdon,', 'pa', '4:23', 'pm.', 'time.', 'closed', '4:45', 'pm', 'arrived.', 'addition', 'this,', 'seats', 'sit', 'train.', 'walk', 'one', 'train', 'car', 'another', 'white', 'male', 'conductor', 'following', 'behind', 'way', 'last', 'car', 'like', 'criminal', 'african', 'american', 'woman', 'long', 'hair.', 'harassed', 'train', 'ticket', 'scan', 'standing', 'heavy', 'luggage,', 'tote', 'bag,', 'shopping', 'bag.', 'inconsiderate.', 'stand', 'time', 'entered', 'train', 'huntingdon,', 'pa', 'till', 'train', 'stopped', 'atloona,', 'pa', 'people', 'get', 'off.', 'seat', 'found', 'dirty', 'food', 'stains', 'it.', 'use', 'hand', 'sanitizer', 'face', 'tissue', 'wipe', 'seat', 'sitting', 'down.', 'usually,', 'passenger', 'enters', 'train,', 'conductor', 'collects', 'scans', 'tickets,', 'waits', 'untill', 'passenger', 'settled', 'his/her', 'seat', 'found', 'comfortable', 'spot', 'stand', 'asking', 'train', 'ticket.', 'white', 'man', 'following', 'behind', 'way', 'unacceptable', 'disrespectful.', 'purchased', 'train', 'tickets', 'paid', 'full.', 'harrassed', 'white', 'man', 'train', 'woman?', 'called', 'several', 'times', 'last', 'saturday,', 'august', '20,', '2022', 'transferred', 'called', 'service', 'hung', 'on.', 'call', 'back', 'again,', 'told', 'customer', 'relations', 'open', 'saturdays.', 'call', 'back', 'monday', 'friday', '8', '8', 'pm.', 'called', 'today', 'august', '22,', '2022,', 'using', 'called', 'back', 'service.', 'hung', 'on.', 'called', 'back', 'decided', 'hold.', 'holding', 'phone', '34', 'minutes', '53', 'seconds', 'got', 'response', 'transffered', 'customer', 'relations.', 'held', '1', 'hour,', '9', 'minutes,', '24', 'seconds.', 'nobody', 'picked', 'phone.']",-0.9216,0.286363636

821,complaintsboard.com,"This regarding Amktrak Vacation Reservation # : 599855

I called the Amtrak Rewards line to get our vacation put on my account.

The gentlemen I spoke to said there was a problem with the hyphen in my name, which we resolved quickly. Then he noticed that the other problem was that the sleeper cars on trans 2 and 6 (Southwest Chief and California Zephyr) for the reservation had been removed from the trains due to electrical issues. So he transferred me to Amtrak Vacations.

The gentleman I spoke to indicated that due to manpower shortages, the sleeper cars could not be manned for those trains on our dates, but then said they had a roomette on the Southwest Chief but only Coach on the Zephyr. Since he was not able to give us a bedroom, I had to cancel the rip.

We have lost the $678 we paid for the insurance and ended up Amtrak credit for $2407.70.

Here are my issues;

1. Why were we not notified that we would not have our accommodations?

2. What would have happened if I had not contacted Amtrak Rewards? Would we have arrived in Chicago and been put in a roomette or lower and in coach seats in Emeryville, CA?

3. Why the discrepancy in explanations? Electrical or manpower?

4. If all sleepers are being taken off, why is there a roomette available?

Before we could go, COVID hit and everything was put on hold. A year later COVID started to settle down so I rebooked the trip. However, just before we could leave a Hurricane hit New Orleans and whipped out the track and the hotel where we were booked. Amtrack gave a voucher to hold until things settled down. I am now 3 years older and my body had deteriorated to a point to where it is hard to walk. So I decided I would just cancel the plan and get back my money. 

Over the past two months I have continuously called Amtrax only to wait on the line for up to 1 /12 hours at a time only to be transferred or put on hold and never answered.

[protected]","in 2020 i scheduled a train trip with amtrak. it was to be our 50th wedding so i wanted to do something special for my wife. the price was $6,578.76. before we could go, covid hit and everything was put on hold. a year later covid started to settle down so i rebooked the trip. however, just before we could leave a hurricane hit new orleans and whipped out the track and the hotel where we were booked. amtrack gave a voucher to hold until things settled down. i am now 3 years older and my body had deteriorated to a point to where it is hard to walk. so i decided i would just cancel the plan and get back my money. 

over the past two months i have continuously called amtrax only to wait on the line for up to 1 /12 hours at a time only to be transferred or put on hold and never answered. 

i have not used any of their services so i would suspect a full refund. if i could ever talk to someone. i tried their internet service but failed to get any resolution. please help.

831,complaintsboard.com,I am traveling on Amtrak surf liner coast train from Oceanside to Los Angeles. Went to food car to purchase wine and chips. Plastic cups were on counter in open so I took one. The counter person said I should not do that. I asked why and he became enraged saying because of covid. I said the cups are in the open with no sign? He then said I am not serving you. I then went to my seat and looked for conductor of the train. Miss K. Williams said she was the conductor and that she couldn’t do anything. She told me the food counter person name is Mark.

Dear AMTRAK:

This letter is in response to horrible service that we received on one of your trains we were on traveling to Delaware from Cary, NC on 7/10/22. We were on the train in route to see my sister in Dover, Delaware for an important family event. When we got to Wilmington we were going to get off and were at the doors but there was apparently an electrical shortage, and the doors did not open in Delaware. 

We had to travel all the way up to Philadelphia but to make matters worse on arrival in Philadelphia we asked a train ticket person what we should do and asked for assistance getting off the train. He was very abrupt, refused to help and started screaming at us. We were unable to get his badge number as he turned it around when we asked for it. We eventually were able to return to Wilmington but at this point we were hours late, missed the car picking us up and had to reschedule the car which cost us more money. This caused us to miss an important event at my sisters which we had spent money to attend. As a result of this horrible service we are requesting a full refund of tickets both coming and going. We returned on 7/14/22 from Delaware to Cary, NC. The other people traveling with me both of whom are senior citizens and disabled and who also received the bad service were Natalie Boone and Mildred Rice. The reservation number was 2E1F7F. Thank you.

846,complaintsboard.com,"I am writing to file a complaint with Amtrak for services on 6/11 and 6/17. First, I was traveling with my sister who requires accessible seating, she travels with a wheelchair and a walker and I was traveling with my 14 year old son who is still very dependent. 

Upon boarding the 4:30 train at Philadelphia, it was packed. A woman traveling with her infant and companion had to leave the seats that were for my sister and a companion. I told my son to sit with my sister because I didn't want him on another cart by himself. Meanwhile, I had to search for a seat, but returned to my sister and son after not finding one close by. My sister opted to sit in her wheelchair from Philadelphia to Norfolk, Virginia.

While in Fredericksburg, Virginia, the conductor announced that he could no longer drive the train because he could not exceed 12 hours and that his relief was traveling from Richmond. We waited 45 minutes or so. We were supposed to arrive to my mother's who is recovering from a near death illness at 11:30pm. My brother who picked us up from the train station had his five year old daughter with him when we arrived after 1:15 AM. By the time we were situated and in bed it was 3:00am. My sister requires rest and meds and she took ill later that day.

Our return trip was just as crowded. People did not wear masks, some were coughing and families were separated. The wheelchair accessible bathroom was full of water/urine that I cleaned with gloves and my foot so my sister would not slip and fall. Even after cleaning, tissue was all over the floor. There were people who came around to collect trash but did not check the bathrooms.

It was pointless to collect tickets a second time since everyone was scattered. Passengers had to assist me in getting my sister off the train in her wheelchair because no one came and said anything to us about a ramp upon our sudden arrival to Philadelphia. We were afraid we would be stuck on the train. After everyone had boarded and de-boarded the train, my family and I were the only ones standing on the platform. The train had not left the station yet. Moments later, the conductor comes and says she was coming and there was only two of them.

Lastly, it has been two days since our return trip to Philadelphia and I tested positive for COVID today after showing symptoms yesterday, which I think was from the crowded unmasked train.

Sincerely,

Nayjuana Stephens","i am writing to file a complaint with amtrak for services on 6/11 and 6/17. first, i was traveling with my sister who requires accessible seating, she travels with a wheelchair and a walker and i was traveling with my 14 year old son who is still very dependent.

On May 30th my friend and I arrived in Houston at the train/bus station where we caught our bus back to Longview Texas.. We left Houston at 1:a5-1;15 and headed back to Longview. Before we got on we were told something very disturbing about our train and we were given a choice to make another reservation, only to find out we couldn't get that train until the 4th of June, Now how many people has the money to reschedule and stay that long. NOT ME not my friend that traveled with me, we both have jobs and are on disability plus I have had a liver transplant and didn't pack enough medication for me to stay that long. It would have cost an arm and a leg, to get another rental, hotel and whatever.. So we went, we had to sit in that train station till1:00 am and I tried to get a sleeper on the way back and they wanted 250 more on top of what I paid, that there was absolutely wrong with all we were going through already. Me having 27 surgeries, 7 on my neck, 3 lower back surgeries, liver transplant, spleen removed, elbow, 4 on my nasal which made it worse to breathe and the gentlemen behind the desk said Amtrak is not going to give anyone any accommodations, I have been with them to many years not to know this. Another issue. With as huge as y'all are and can't even have someone fix the AC unit but let someone have a stroke or die from Asthma or something. Shame on you guys.. I am so disgusted with this trip that I will be traveling another way from now on and I will tell everyone how we got treated while riding in no air. The last guy that came on board was very upset and told everyone to contact Amtrak when we could and complain. He brought big bags of ice and passed it around the only one who cared. Amtrak is huge and could have called someone to meet us at a train stop and fix that AC, I talked to several people who knows these trains and they threw a fit the way this was NOT handled but let us get sick and overheated. You honestly need to make this right because people depend on this transportation to get around and us that our disabled anyway can't handle this kind of stuff, I tried sitting in there to eat and the conductor said no, what a shame..

Shorltly after the train departed, she stopped by and took our lunch order and time we wished to be served. We ordered and asked for a 1:30 time.

She never responded. Another passenger in the same car was also trying to find how to exit when we came to Lakeland. The three of us then walked the length of our car and another trying to find help. Some how we ended up at the luggage compartment. The young lady in front of us yelled for help to get us off, we were told to return to our rooms and the attendant that was in luggage would come to us.

Details re: of the ticket are below. 

The problem: 

1. Occasional sewage smell in our sleeper car and constant sewage smell in our traveling companions' car on the way to Glenwood/

2. On the return trip — we traded with our companions so that they would not have to endure as much of a smell. Also, we thought they were just being overly sensitive. They were not. the smell was horrible. We complained to our porter, Mary, who showed us that she had been reporting the problem since APRIL 11 — but the systems stemming from one bathroom were inoperational.

3. At Denver, she managed to move us to the next train car, where the smell was more intermittent — it came whenever someone opened the doors between cars. 

It's unacceptable and dangerous to breathe sewage for 24 hours at a time — especially during a pandemic.

My train trip - Sacramento - Seattle - Vancouver - was booked and paid for in full on August 13, 2021, with departure date of MON OCT 4, and returning THURS OCT 14.
However, I broke my wrist on September 17, which required a surgery scheduled for Sept 29. I called your company SEPT 21 or Sept 22 to see if I could delay the start of the trip for a few days because I needed some time to recover from the surgery. I requested that I leave Sacramento on THURS OCT 7, rather than MON Oct 4.
Alarmingly, I was informed by the ""customer service rep"" during that phone call that Amtrak was ""not going into Canada anymore."" However, a few days prior to my call, I had literally received via email all the travel documents from Sacramento to Vancouver, without any indication of the changes! The travel documents sent to me on September 20, 2021 included:
""DAY 3 SEATTLE TO VANCOUVER: Today, travel to the Amtrak station and journey to Vancouver, British Columbia. Sit back and relax on the scenic ride through the northwest! Pull into Vancouver and travel to your hotel to check-in and drop your luggage then use your included admission to the Vancouver Lookout. (Overnight in Vancouver)""
The ""customer service"" rep had no idea why I received those documents and was rather dismissive, ""Oh, well, I don't know who booked you but we don't go there anymore…. there's nothing I can do.""
What would I have done upon my arrival to Seattle without knowing at that time that there was NO AMTRAK bus into Canada as scheduled? 
I cancelled the itinerary from Sacramento to Seattle and agreed to the voucher form of the ""refund"" but kept the various reservations in Vancouver/BC to see if I could find another mode of transportation into Canada. 
Because I had planned the trip months earlier, and made arrangements to take time off work, get my passport, arrange pet/house sitting etc. I immediately called Air Canada to see if I could get a flight into Canada. They were accepting passengers for flights to Vancouver from CA - passengers were required to be vaccinated (I am) and tested 72 hours prior to travel (I did). 
However, on the day of my trip THURS OCT 7 to Vancouver, as I prepared to board my flight, I was informed I made a mistake with the timing of the COVID test i.e. the covid test I took was timed for the first leg of the plane trip on THURS OCT 7 from Sacramento (1045 am) not the second leg on the same day from LA to Vancouver (1245 pm). I was unable to get on the plan because I was informed that the test was 74 hours old verses 72 hours old. 
I immediately took another COVID test at the airport on THURS OCT 7, booked another flight to Canada for FRI OCT 8, and called Amtrak to cancel the hotel and the events scheduled for THURS OCT 7. I was told that because I was not within the 24 hour cancellation policy for the hotel, I would not receive a refund, but the cost of the events would be refunded as a voucher. 
The results of the COVID test I took on THURS OCT 7 did not come back in time for me to travel to Canada on FRI OCT 8, so I called Amtrak again to cancel the hotels in Vancouver and BC (six nights) and the events - the ferry, and exploding Victoria, the trip to BC etc. 
At that time, I was informed I would not be able to get any refund or voucher for the Vancouver/BC part of the trip (to include the hotels reservation for the 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14) because I was in the ""penalty phase."" So, the day before on THURS OCT 7 I was told I could cancel the hotel reservations if I did so within 24 hours prior to arrival but the next day on FRI OCT 8 I was told I COULD not do so? 
I was well within the time frame to cancel the hotel reservations (which was confirmed by the hotel staff in Canada when I called them On FRII Oct 8) for the Sat OCT 9, Sun OCT 10, Mon OCT 11, Tues OCT 12, Wed OCT 13 and Thurs OCT 14.
I have attempted to resolve the issue to no avail: Per email on Jan 3, 2022 and Oct 12, 2021 from Karen M. ""Customer Care Specialist"" with ""Yankee Leisure Group"" ""Good Afternoon Angela, For this reservation you did not have any trip protection, so in this case there is nothing we can do in regards to refunding or creating credits. I would advise to file through a 3rd party insurance company if you have one.""
What is most egregious about this issue is that the Amtrak customer is the only one in this equation who is suffering any consequences for AMTRAK's ineptitude! A company that emails travel vouchers for transportation into a country where AMTRAK had decided to NOT provide transportation is shockingly inept. The fact that it was only by chance that I was informed of this prior to travel is misconduct. 
Because of AMTRAKs misconduct, a sequence of unfortunate events unfolded, and I appear to be the only one who will bear the consequences. 
Again, AMTRAK‘s misconduct is the precipitant to my having to scramble to get transportation for my long planned ""train travel"" vacation; add to this, in the time of the COVID pandemic, the misery of air travel (which is why I choose the train), since no one is completely sure about the ""timing"" of the test results as evidenced by me joining a group of other passengers who didn't board the plane to Vancouver on Oct 7 due to ""issues"" with the COVID test. 
In the last ten years, I have travelled on Amtrak down to San Francisco and back to Sacramento at least 40 times. I've convinced my family and friends to join me numerous times and have been an ambassador for train travel. 
Rest assured, if I am not provided a full refund of $2232.54 from Amtrak for this disaster that Amtrak set into motion, my train travel will not be deterred. However, I will share my story with every single person I meet on the train, and to every single person I talk to about travelling by train. 
Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.

895,complaintsboard.com,"The video with the instigator, a black male conductor, and a couple other videos, appear to be too large a file, they are not uploading. I will cut a brief clip from one to upload so you can identify the culprit who made unlawful and improper racial comments as well as refused me passage DESPITE ALL OF AMTRAK's published policies, months of ridership without incident, and federal law... He even admits he never even looked at the ticket. He simply checked the itinerary afterward to see who had a ticket, hadn't boarded, and passed that info to the next conductor. See that video, I have 8 original videos altogether.

Following is the same recap shared with attorneys currently considering my claim against Amtrak with the video evidence. I have several videos, all taken from public ingress/egress easements where there is no legal right to any expectation of privacy documenting this misconduct, which I began to document after multiple racism implying comments by the initial (black) conductor indicating I was unwelcome on the basis of his personal views on skin color and current politics:

***********************************************************************
Today I'm in a lot of pain still, added to by a sleepless night due to seizures related to health issues, some of which by ALL guidelines, CDC included, exempt me from the ""mandates, "" even for travel purposes a la air or train or other federally regulated travel. Mention as related to additional need, separate from being deprived of work here in CA over the rampant paranoid delusions and responses thereto over the covid narratives.

For Months I have travelled across state lines, as well as from my home in Orange County, CA to San Diego, CA for social as well as odd job purposes related to my artwork and trying to build a business I won't have to rely on politics sensitive enterprises. In almost all cases for the past year I have used Amtrak (best network and accessibility points for my purposes.

Last night, Dec. 4th, I was denied access to an Amtrak train by a rabid (black) racist conductor. He made several insulting and false comments regarding my ""entitled"" status and person, implying race, and that they were why I would not be allowed on not only his, but any Amtrak train. When he realized I was recording him with my cell phone, he changed his narrative to ""I/we (who is ""we""?!?) no longer feel safe with you unmasked in our presence"" followed up by ""I/we no longer feel safe with you on any train."" Amtrak allows conductors final say on who is allowed or not on a train it turns out. Some consult the engineer, most do not, in my experience.

This same person (name badge on one of the videos but I'm not looking at it, no prior interactions ever I know of) left me, dressed for a daylight trip for a quick side job, with an immediate daytime turnaround back home, all to be completed before dark, stranded at the station in San Diego (thank God it was there and not Alaska!) for the next 3 hours, underdressed for the weather as my task was indoors and as I said both trips and work were all to be completed during daylight hours, with me arriving home near or just after dark. Instead, I was left underdressed and without recourse for several hours after dark awaiting the next scheduled train on that route. No further information or directions were provided to me, only that I would have to catch another train, he wasn't letting me ride under any other circumstances. He also made a number of surreptitious comments, many I did not catch, to a number of other black employees of Amtrak, including one who became extremely hostile towards me henceforth. It was an open comment that had sparked my belief that I needed to film and record his behavior in the first place. Another black female, initially hostile, after further interaction with me, relaxed and abandoned her hostility entire. At no time did I act inappropriate, though I had informed and maintained that for health reasons I was ADA exempt and had travelled that very morning, and for the past 6 months (closer to a year total) on numerous Amtrak lines and routes without any trouble whatsoever ever, without ever wearing a mask, and being exempt under their policy and all guidelines (regardless if one feels the mandates are lawful or not). This is fact. I can produce receipts/ticket confirmations by email of numerous trips. Not all, but most are emailed to me due to how I book. NEVER in a year has a single Amtrak staff informed me of a different process for booking if an exemption is claimed or to be provided. On two prior occasions a conductor had commented that there ""should be"" a way to comment that when a ticket is booked so that the conductor is notified when they scan the ticket so no conversation is even necessary - but when you book there is not, nor is ANY indication that it is even possible outside one's personal knowledge and assertion of rights that it is possible to be exempted from their policy and ""mandate."" None whatsoever, and no opportunity to append any note or comment on your reservation whatsoever.

This same black employee contacted, after the train departed and we parted ways, the platform staff (a thenceforth militantly hostile black female) and the conductors on the train scheduled after him, givign them my name and unknown details that resulted in their first exchange, on the subsequent train, even before they viewed my ticket to ask ""is he going to behave this time."" That was the only portion I could overhear. There was more said. One staff was mixed black and the other white. The mixed deferred to the white, but ultimately started repeating a falsity to justify them leaving me behind again, after offering me a false ""compromise"" that they then refused to perform 100% without provocation, also captured on video. The mixed black began repeating the ""magic words"" ""at this point I don't feel safe with him being on board without a mask on as we do, "" despite the fact her mask was not only useless regardless but was not worn to cover her nose at the time, a fact I comment on in my video when she start that false narrative.

The second conductor (the white lady) admits that the former conductor relayed my name to her with a warning to keep me off the train and she wasn't going to side with me over her coworker, regardless of my actual behavior not conforming with whatever he reported, the details of which she would not divulge.

Station staff disagreed with the entire events but stated they had no authority over the conductor. They assured me it was being written up and provided for action when supervisors were around again Monday, but could take no action to remedy or counteract the rogue conductor's misinformation and misconduct that night. Though there was another train that night, I would be stranded, still miles from home, at the far end regardless after the 1st train I was denied passage upon. Ultimately, that staff offered to refund my ticket and helped find an alternative in the right direction, though her information was incomplete and the route expected was not available at that hour on any weekend so I was stranded about midway between San Diego where these incidents occurred and my home. My only option from that midpoint on was a much more expensive Lyft ride home, which ultimately added to my health problems as I am allergic to chemicals in cigarettes and my driver smoked, the residue of which I reacted to strongly over the 45 minute ride home, but faced with the prospect of being stuck in the open overnight... This expense alone establishes material injury beyond the unjustified inconveniences based on racism permitted by political narrative (the entire BLM and leftist mantra of a white male being somehow 'elite' and privileged etc., when I did absolutely nothing out of the ordinary or impolite until a black person expressed their racist opinion and that they had the power and would exercise it to counteract my perceived ""entitlement.""). Throughout I remained firm and unyielding but civil and polite, and the videos will confirm that assertion. They were all filmed from a public access sidewalk, and not on any private conveyance or property (I never got even a step on any train by their forceful interference) therefore easements and public lack of privacy expectations apply (the black employees and an offended passenger who added her own snide remarks were ignorant of these facts) because the offenders of course at some point made it clear they did not wish their misconduct recorded.

Following this, and getting home late that night, the weather and chemical exposures, no doubt in combination if not alone, I began experiencing extremely painful seizures that repeated intermittently for hours, further depriving me of sleep, which can be evasive at the best of times due to breathing problems, one of the multiple health matters for which I assert my lawful (under any scenario) disability and exemption from their b.s.. Which I've done for the past year, and have never had any problem except an occasional snide comment, usually from another passenger less informed. Today I'm still in a lot of pain and of course a sleepless night after nearly 24 hours of activity related to preparation and travel for a sorely needed side job (photography, self employed gig). The seizures have stopped early in the morning but this is not a laughing matter and even the first conductor's behavior, apart from anything else that followed that he also caused with deliberate intent and out of and beyond his normal duties actions, was found by station employees who overheard it, witnessed it and me throughout, or heard it relayed to them by other Amtrak employees, found it completely out of line and improper, even without hearing the implied racial comments, and who told me (multiple individuals) just let it go and take the next train, there should be no hassle with the next one. One such employee specifically said ""maybe it's time someone sued Amtrak over this nonsense.""

A call to Amtrak with a very extended wait while I was trying to find an alternate route home last night, determined that ALL Amtrak conductors did not know company policy and had incorrectly informed me of numerous facts and policies and procedures, but if those same policies and procedures were followed, they still violated Title II of the ADA and their own pulbished policies, and they did not provide me a route home that night, compounding the injury done.

The insanity in CA really gone too far, and various comments by Amtrak employees made it clear that it is an ""open secret"" that Amtrak is a leftist dependent and would no longer exist without handouts and subsidization and this in turn foments more divisive and inappropriate behavior and thoughts. This alone, with the fact that they'll ultimately pay legal fees for their violations of their own policies and federal law (discrimination, and failure to abide by ADA) I would hope would attract an attorney to make a point. I regret needing to rely on them for much of my local regional travel.

I have had countless similar encounters and threats of violence over the past year in CA. The leftist fear-mongering, terror tactics, and narrative in CA are beyond out of control. I could provide an ambitious attorney(s) with numerous actions against a few other very large corporations who violated ADA and equal protection laws and fell back on the political narrative to justify their outrageous and unlawful violations. But this one, with the night of agony that followed, definitely went too far. Getting several blacks violently riled up against me without cause was beyond unconscionable, not to mention deliberately trying to strand me, inconvenience me, and prevent my return home should not be allowed to be swept aside and forgotten.

****************************************************

I took ill for three days following sending this to my initial attorney for a local referral due to exposure and breathing related matters collateral from the unexpected exposure.

Note that all of this behavior violated ALL of Amtrak's own published policies and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. It also violated all published policies of Amtrak, or ANY related ""mandate"" or related issue, as ALL SUCH refer back to ""per CDC guidelines"" which I keep bookmarked on my phone for reference, and which explicitly say individuals such as myself, are, and always have been, exempt from any such mask or similar expectation or ""requirement.""

Note also that this exact verbiage above was attempted to be transmitted direct to Amtrak through their site, and an automated email issued in response claiming that ""hate speech"" was detected above and the request was not processed as a result. Multiple attempts to submit provided no differing result. Reference to unfulfilled Amtrak reservations: B0B66E & B067C7. Numerous prior reservations over the past year without any incident related to discrimination (I didn't even complain when I got stuck in Union station overnight due to an Amtrak employee error that stranded me at my expense) or similar violation of my ADA rights to transport unhindered.","the video with the instigator, a black male conductor, and a couple other videos, appear to be too large a file, they are not uploading. i will cut a brief clip from one to upload so you can identify the culprit who made unlawful and improper racial comments as well as refused me passage despite all of amtrak's published policies, months of ridership without incident, and federal law... he even admits he never even looked at the ticket. he simply checked the itinerary afterward to see who had a ticket, hadn't boarded, and passed that info to the next conductor. see that video, i have 8 original videos altogether.

following is the same recap shared with attorneys currently considering my claim against amtrak with the video evidence. i have several videos, all taken from public ingress/egress easements where there is no legal right to any expectation of privacy documenting this misconduct, which i began to document after multiple racism implying comments by the initial (black) conductor indicating i was unwelcome on the basis of his personal views on skin color and current politics:

***********************************************************************
today i'm in a lot of pain still, added to by a sleepless night due to seizures related to health issues, some of which by all guidelines, cdc included, exempt me from the ""mandates, "" even for travel purposes a la air or train or other federally regulated travel. mention as related to additional need, separate from being deprived of work here in ca over the rampant paranoid delusions and responses thereto over the covid narratives.

for months i have travelled across state lines, as well as from my home in orange county, ca to san diego, ca for social as well as odd job purposes related to my artwork and trying to build a business i won't have to rely on politics sensitive enterprises. in almost all cases for the past year i have used amtrak (best network and accessibility points for my purposes.

last night, dec. 4th, i was denied access to an amtrak train by a rabid (black) racist conductor. he made several insulting and false comments regarding my ""entitled"" status and person, implying race, and that they were why i would not be allowed on not only his, but any amtrak train. when he realized i was recording him with my cell phone, he changed his narrative to ""i/we (who is ""we""?!?) no longer feel safe with you unmasked in our presence"" followed up by ""i/we no longer feel safe with you on any train."" amtrak allows conductors final say on who is allowed or not on a train it turns out. some consult the engineer, most do not, in my experience.

this same person (name badge on one of the videos but i'm not looking at it, no prior interactions ever i know of) left me, dressed for a daylight trip for a quick side job, with an immediate daytime turnaround back home, all to be completed before dark, stranded at the station in san diego (thank god it was there and not alaska!) for the next 3 hours, underdressed for the weather as my task was indoors and as i said both trips and work were all to be completed during daylight hours, with me arriving home near or just after dark. instead, i was left underdressed and without recourse for several hours after dark awaiting the next scheduled train on that route. no further information or directions were provided to me, only that i would have to catch another train, he wasn't letting me ride under any other circumstances. he also made a number of surreptitious comments, many i did not catch, to a number of other black employees of amtrak, including one who became extremely hostile towards me henceforth. it was an open comment that had sparked my belief that i needed to film and record his behavior in the first place. another black female, initially hostile, after further interaction with me, relaxed and abandoned her hostility entire. at no time did i act inappropriate, though i had informed and maintained that for health reasons i was ada exempt and had travelled that very morning, and for the past 6 months (closer to a year total) on numerous amtrak lines and routes without any trouble whatsoever ever, without ever wearing a mask, and being exempt under their policy and all guidelines (regardless if one feels the mandates are lawful or not). this is fact. i can produce receipts/ticket confirmations by email of numerous trips. not all, but most are emailed to me due to how i book. never in a year has a single amtrak staff informed me of a different process for booking if an exemption is claimed or to be provided. on two prior occasions a conductor had commented that there ""should be"" a way to comment that when a ticket is booked so that the conductor is notified when they scan the ticket so no conversation is even necessary - but when you book there is not, nor is any indication that it is even possible outside one's personal knowledge and assertion of rights that it is possible to be exempted from their policy and ""mandate."" none whatsoever, and no opportunity to append any note or comment on your reservation whatsoever.

this same black employee contacted, after the train departed and we parted ways, the platform staff (a thenceforth militantly hostile black female) and the conductors on the train scheduled after him, givign them my name and unknown details that resulted in their first exchange, on the subsequent train, even before they viewed my ticket to ask ""is he going to behave this time."" that was the only portion i could overhear. there was more said. one staff was mixed black and the other white. the mixed deferred to the white, but ultimately started repeating a falsity to justify them leaving me behind again, after offering me a false ""compromise"" that they then refused to perform 100% without provocation, also captured on video. the mixed black began repeating the ""magic words"" ""at this point i don't feel safe with him being on board without a mask on as we do, "" despite the fact her mask was not only useless regardless but was not worn to cover her nose at the time, a fact i comment on in my video when she start that false narrative.

the second conductor (the white lady) admits that the former conductor relayed my name to her with a warning to keep me off the train and she wasn't going to side with me over her coworker, regardless of my actual behavior not conforming with whatever he reported, the details of which she would not divulge.

station staff disagreed with the entire events but stated they had no authority over the conductor. they assured me it was being written up and provided for action when supervisors were around again monday, but could take no action to remedy or counteract the rogue conductor's misinformation and misconduct that night. though there was another train that night, i would be stranded, still miles from home, at the far end regardless after the 1st train i was denied passage upon. ultimately, that staff offered to refund my ticket and helped find an alternative in the right direction, though her information was incomplete and the route expected was not available at that hour on any weekend so i was stranded about midway between san diego where these incidents occurred and my home. my only option from that midpoint on was a much more expensive lyft ride home, which ultimately added to my health problems as i am allergic to chemicals in cigarettes and my driver smoked, the residue of which i reacted to strongly over the 45 minute ride home, but faced with the prospect of being stuck in the open overnight... this expense alone establishes material injury beyond the unjustified inconveniences based on racism permitted by political narrative (the entire blm and leftist mantra of a white male being somehow 'elite' and privileged etc., when i did absolutely nothing out of the ordinary or impolite until a black person expressed their racist opinion and that they had the power and would exercise it to counteract my perceived ""entitlement.""). throughout i remained firm and unyielding but civil and polite, and the videos will confirm that assertion. they were all filmed from a public access sidewalk, and not on any private conveyance or property (i never got even a step on any train by their forceful interference) therefore easements and public lack of privacy expectations apply (the black employees and an offended passenger who added her own snide remarks were ignorant of these facts) because the offenders of course at some point made it clear they did not wish their misconduct recorded.

following this, and getting home late that night, the weather and chemical exposures, no doubt in combination if not alone, i began experiencing extremely painful seizures that repeated intermittently for hours, further depriving me of sleep, which can be evasive at the best of times due to breathing problems, one of the multiple health matters for which i assert my lawful (under any scenario) disability and exemption from their b.s.. which i've done for the past year, and have never had any problem except an occasional snide comment, usually from another passenger less informed. today i'm still in a lot of pain and of course a sleepless night after nearly 24 hours of activity related to preparation and travel for a sorely needed side job (photography, self employed gig). the seizures have stopped early in the morning but this is not a laughing matter and even the first conductor's behavior, apart from anything else that followed that he also caused with deliberate intent and out of and beyond his normal duties actions, was found by station employees who overheard it, witnessed it and me throughout, or heard it relayed to them by other amtrak employees, found it completely out of line and improper, even without hearing the implied racial comments, and who told me (multiple individuals) just let it go and take the next train, there should be no hassle with the next one. one such employee specifically said ""maybe it's time someone sued amtrak over this nonsense.""

a call to amtrak with a very extended wait while i was trying to find an alternate route home last night, determined that all amtrak conductors did not know company policy and had incorrectly informed me of numerous facts and policies and procedures, but if those same policies and procedures were followed, they still violated title ii of the ada and their own pulbished policies, and they did not provide me a route home that night, compounding the injury done.

the insanity in ca really gone too far, and various comments by amtrak employees made it clear that it is an ""open secret"" that amtrak is a leftist dependent and would no longer exist without handouts and subsidization and this in turn foments more divisive and inappropriate behavior and thoughts. this alone, with the fact that they'll ultimately pay legal fees for their violations of their own policies and federal law (discrimination, and failure to abide by ada) i would hope would attract an attorney to make a point. i regret needing to rely on them for much of my local regional travel.

i have had countless similar encounters and threats of violence over the past year in ca. the leftist fear-mongering, terror tactics, and narrative in ca are beyond out of control. i could provide an ambitious attorney(s) with numerous actions against a few other very large corporations who violated ada and equal protection laws and fell back on the political narrative to justify their outrageous and unlawful violations. but this one, with the night of agony that followed, definitely went too far. getting several blacks violently riled up against me without cause was beyond unconscionable, not to mention deliberately trying to strand me, inconvenience me, and prevent my return home should not be allowed to be swept aside and forgotten.

****************************************************

i took ill for three days following sending this to my initial attorney for a local referral due to exposure and breathing related matters collateral from the unexpected exposure.

note that all of this behavior violated all of amtrak's own published policies and title ii of the americans with disabilities act (ada) and section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973. it also violated all published policies of amtrak, or any related ""mandate"" or related issue, as all such refer back to ""per cdc guidelines"" which i keep bookmarked on my phone for reference, and which explicitly say individuals such as myself, are, and always have been, exempt from any such mask or similar expectation or ""requirement.""

note also that this exact verbiage above was attempted to be transmitted direct to amtrak through their site, and an automated email issued in response claiming that ""hate speech"" was detected above

I recently had to book a train for my in-laws to come visit us. After numerous times trying to use your website which does not work at all, and no one seems to be correcting the issue, I was told to call Customer Service to book my travel.

I spent about 1.15 hours on hold waiting to book my travel. The person who took my booking did not spell my email correctly, so I never received any confirmation of the dates/times.

I called today and spoke to a person named K. after being on hold for 1.5 hours. His aggressive and annoyed tone (like I was imposing on him) were not appropriate. He was going to email me my itinerary, and said he sent the email. I spelled my email address to him and he said everything is spelled correctly on his side, and to check my spam/trash/etc.

At this point I asked to be transferred to a manage, he response was dismissive, telling me he would transfer me once we were done.

He then asked for an alternative email address and I was was telling him this address he realized he had spelled my email incorrectly. Now I clearly spelled this out to him, but he did not listen, instead he proceed to tell me he had spelled it out to me and I had somehow told him [protected] is correct. In what world would I say my email was correct if indeed it was spelled incorrectly?

The truth is he sent the email to the same address the original person spelled incorrectly. He did not verify my email address (again, I would not say that the email was ok if he would have told me what he had on file).

Once I finally received the itinerary in email he hung up on my without transferring me to a manager.

1. Please fix your website? If the website were working I would not have had to be exposed to your customer service which was very poor IMHO.
2. Hire more customer service employees! I should not have to wait for over an hour or hour and a half to speak to someone. You need help here

922,complaintsboard.com,"I was a passenger on train #65 @ 10:22 pm from Providence R. I. to Thurgood Marshall BWI on August 7 2021. Resv. #123743

During that trip I was disrespected by the conductor. I feel I was blatantly discriminated against. I'm not sure if it was because I am a senior or because I am a lady of color. I was assigned a single seat so maybe he didn't feel I qualified to have a single seat. I still don't understand why I was treated that way, I really feel it was because of my color.
let me give some background:

From the moment I sat down the conductor came to me and said, ""I don't think you belong in that seat"". I showed him my ticket, he said, ""you can't sit here because I'm showing you as a no show"", my reply how can I be a no-show when I'm sitting here, he then said he show me as a no show going to Rhode Island, (surely I didn't walk from Maryland to Rhode Island). he insisted that I move that he could find me a seat in Coach. I said I paid for business and wasn't going to coach. He continued to come back and harass me, finally I agreed to move to a seat further up because by that time I was getting nervous and stressed out. He took me to the front of the car and said he had reserved me a seat in 1d when we get to New York. That trip to N.Y. was the most miserable ride ever. I felt every bump and twist, consequently my sciatic nerve was bruised.
Then to add insult to injury when we got to N.Y. I was seated right across the isle from my original seat and no one sat there from N.Y. to BWI, also before N.Y. I went to the restroom at some point and the seat was empty. I think he felt I did not deserve to be in business class and certainly not in a single seat.

That conductor needs people skill especially when dealing with Brown skin people. He need to know color discrimination is illegal and will not be tolerated. I'm sure your records will identify him.

I had already booked a trip for October 13 and 19, reservation # 56B004, I hope the employees are not as arrogant.

937,complaintsboard.com,"I was on the #27 train, the Empire Builder and stepped off to stretch my legs and take a smoke break at the Spokane, WA train station at 2:20am this morning, June 27th. I asked the one train attendant outside on the platform when the train was going to depart, how much time I had, and he said ""A full hour"". He said I had an hour from that moment I asked him how much time we had, not ten minutes or five minutes left of that ""full hour"". I decided to then take a quick stroll downtown to sight see, being I seemingly had a full hour left. I did so keeping an eye on the clock and returned at 2:50am, a half hour later, under the full hour. When I got back, the train had left. I met up with a security guard named Tommy who brought me down to the Amtrak office to speak with Wyatt and Matthew, who took down the details of my carry on belongings and checked baggage. They radioed ahead to the next train stop following Spokane to gather my carrycots and have them return here at the Spokane WA train station the same time the next morning when the train's on its way back to Spokane and that my checked baggage goes to Portland Oregon, my final destination where they're held on to for me. I was then given a ticket to leave on the next train this morning headed to PDX around the same time 24 hours later on a day it's supposed to have extreme heat, without my water bottle, my ID, or my wallet so I could get something to eat in this time frame.

I think it's completely unprofessional for the train attendant to say I had ""a full hour"" when I seemingly only had 10mins left of that hour stop, where they split up the train, half going to Seattle and the other half going to Portland. He withheld telling me the exact amount of time left before the train departed the station. This has effectively stolen my time from me while putting my carry-ons in the position of potentially being stolen or damaged. It has messed up a scheduled ride I had for me this morning at 10:10am when I was meant to arrive at the PDX station that I will not have tomorrow morning. This has caused me significant emotional distress on top of my PTSD because it's not only my personal belongings, my identification and wallet and money, it's also my art portfolio that been taken out of my care effectively putting my intellectual property in jeopardy. This is an abuse of power and someone should not be in that job position to give ambiguous times of departure to travelers withholding the exact time, misleading the traveler to believe they have more time than they do per stop. This is completely unprofessional and disingenuous. Someone should not hold that work position with Amtrak to do this to any travelers again, who have paid for tickets and made other ride arrangements that then become totally messed up while putting the traveler's property in threat of theft, loss and/or damage. This train attendant was on the Empire Builder #27 from Memphis to Chicago to Spokane and is a middle aged stocky African American man who wears a Bluetooth ear piece.

939,complaintsboard.com,"I booked a ticket for my brother (age: 86) New Rochelle, NY to Meriden, CT on #148 etd 7:26pm. We arrived an hour early and saw that the posted time was changed to 7:56pm. There were no station attendants available for any updated information or to provide alternative connections. We waited until eventually a new time of 8:26pm was posted. At no time was any relevant announcement made. We waited. Other Amtrak trains passed thru, with possible connections to Meriden, but we had no way of knowing for sure. I tried calling Amtrak and listened to an endless supply of recordings while on HOLD. No one ever answered. It started getting dark and cold with no bathroom facilities nearby. Eventually the time was changed on the board to 8:56pm. My brother, by now, was very agitated and extremely nervous, besides needing a bathroom. An Amtrak train pulled into the station at 8:53pm. There was no announcement, no train markings and no conductor visible. My brother boarded the train. I started to leave and heard someone say it was the train to Boston. I became frantic and began waving my arms and calling for help. A conductor appeared from the front of the train, approached me and helped locate my brother who then got off.
A possible tragic situation was avoided. The correct Amtrak train finally pulled in 15-20 minutes later. Fortunately, this time the conductor was easily spotted in the middle car and confirmed this was the correct train. This 1hr - 45 minute delay was very unfortunate. The absence of ANY meaningful communication was irresponsible, dangerous and unforgivable. It would have allowed us an opportunity to decide how to best handle the situation instead of remaining clueless the entire time while sitting, waiting and not knowing what to do. 
This is the 21st century and we are able to make pinpoint landings on the Moon and Mars. How is it possible that Amtrak's service can be so terribly deficient and lacking in the basics? Amtrak must take responsibility to ensure that its passengers are not risking their health or their lives just by taking a 1 hour and 51 minute ride.

Attendant never answer the call button, waited 2 hours
Returning train had been sanitized with liquid coming down the walls
Original Reservation #BCA1DA
Unacceptable formatted email with a $250.00 voucher, refused
Traveling First Class, First Time Bedroom Suite, wasn't First

After a nightmare trip last year in June 2020 when our train broke down in the middle of the night, we sat still for over 16 hours with NO info at all! No one would tell us anything & we couldn't get off the train. Finally, after a lot of trying, we reached a cust. service line and we were offered a partial favor by offering us a credit to use within a year. Taking this offer, trying to give Amtrak a break, we tried to book this year and the prices keep changing. On one day the tickets show as one price ($368 @ 20%), 3 days later they are doubled ($687 @ 20%), and 2 days after that they have tripled ($867 @ 20%). And occupancy still says it is the same. Called Cust. Serv. to verify and we were told 'that is the price, you will have to deal with'. No other explanation. Unbelievable that this long time company is so rude and un-accommodating.

At no time in the next 20 minutes, did any Amtrak attendant come to check this out. A chemistry teacher who was on the train put out the first electrical fire. Nobody was told anything for a long time and 2 more fires started with a tremendous amount of smoke. Finally, they moved us to the other cars where we stood like sardines.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing regarding my extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment with my travel experience on Amtrak's Coastal Starlight Train Numbers 11 and 14 last week.

My husband and I were booked and paid in advance for Monday December 23, 2019 trip on Coastal Starlight Train Number 11 from Eugene, Oregon to Redding, California. Several hours into our trip we noticed we were freezing cold and there was obviously no heat. We asked for blankets and were told we could purchase them on the train but the train did not provide blankets. An hour later we learned that the heat had not been turned on. After another hour we found out that the heater was not working and that it would be fixed shortly, it was not. We again requested blankets, thinking an exception would be made under the circumstances. Instead we were told there were no extra blankets available for train passengers. There was no apology, no offer of a hot beverage, nothing. We traveled at night for nine hours without heat. We spent the entire trip in our coats and gloves.

Our return trip on Coastal Starlight Train No. 14 from Redding, CA to Eugene, OR on December 27, 2019 was a living nightmare! I checked the train status before we left the house and learned the train was delayed by an hour and half and we adjusted accordingly. The Redding train depot offers no services. There is lobby, there are no bathrooms, there is no seating of any kind and no shelter from the elements. Our train was scheduled to depart at 3:06 a.m. We spent 2 hours in our relative's vehicle waiting on the train. During this time, we checked train status both online and by telephone. Each time I checked there was a different time. People were gathering at the depot and were freezing cold. Nobody left as they were afraid of missing the train.

The information that was provided was vague and gave the impression the train would be arriving within the next hour. Initially we were advised the train would catch up and could be arriving sooner the projected. Customer service recording was of no help. With some digging, we learned there had been an incident with a ""trespasser"" somewhere in Southern California causing the delay. After several hours, the train status showed the train as being in Chico, CA and was momentarily delayed due to a ""trespasser"" (again). Each time the estimated arrival time in Redding was posted as another hour. There was no time to leave and find the nearest bathroom. People were relieving themselves in the bushes. There was no time to go get a cup of coffee to warm up without fear of missing the train. Based on the information provided by Amtrak there were several times people (myself included) unloaded our baggage and moved to the platform expecting the train's arrival. This went on throughout the night. It was horrible. It was only because one of the passenger's daughters worked at a Chico TV station that we learned our train was delayed in Chico because it had struck and killed a man on the tracks.

Since Amtrak was well aware of the incident, they knew the train would not be leaving Chico within an hour after someone had been killed. Why couldn't have Amtrak been honest with us and sent us a text when the train would be actually arriving, allowing people to get warm and grab some breakfast? Both my husband and I are disabled and senior citizens. My husband has Stage 4 terminal cancer and has a nephrostomy tube which requires regular access to a restroom or risk sepsis. The discomfort, frustration, and anxiety forced upon us by the way this situation was handled was unbelievable. Shortly before our train was due to arrive the Union Pacific employee took pity upon us and opened a small portion of the train depot office up to the few passengers still waiting for the train. Our train arrived seven and half hours late!

When the train pulled into the Redding station we all walked down to the car that was opened up. After standing in line a few minutes we were told we needed to turn around and go in the opposite direction, several cars down to board. Being senior citizens, we were now the last in line to board. We realized the train was behind schedule but the way we were herded on the train was disgraceful. I had the door slammed shut on me and the train started up again as we tried to find room for our baggage. There was no room for our bags and no one to help us find room. Once seated, there was no explanation for the delay and no apology. I incorrectly assumed we would be offered breakfast or at least a cup of coffee. I was wrong.

We were unable to sleep because of the constant intercom announcements for lunch reservations, lunch seating, complaints about people showing up in the dining car too early, and on, and on. Rarely did we see anybody from the train staff in our car. Once again, there was no heat. Young children were running up down the isle of the car going from car to car unsupervised. A disoriented gentleman was looking for his luggage insisting it was stolen. He obviously needed assistance but he couldn't find any help. He started to panic and it was obvious he had mental health issues that were being triggered. We became very concerned for our safety. When we finally located a conductor he dismissed the incident as funny.

Prior to arriving at our destination in Eugene, Oregon, we explained our disability situation to the conductor and requested assistance with our baggage. We were assured there would be numerous train personnel to assist us when it came to disembark. There were none. It was difficult to get to our luggage because the passengers who were getting off for a smoke break had blocked the baggage area. A couple of them had been drinking (per their statements) and were not real cooperative about moving out of the way or letting us through. There were no train personnel anywhere to be found.

Because we were late arriving, I received a parking ticket because I never anticipated I would need to pay for time after I was scheduled to arrive. The train ride in itself was quite nice and we would like to do it again but under the conditions we experienced on both trains, it was obvious this was standard operating procedure for Amtrak.

I have enclosed copies of our train tickets and request full reimbursement. I believe for the nightmare we were subjected to, the rude employees, the unreasonable time delay, and the sheer lack of empathy and courtesy we are entitled to just compensation. I hope your company is embarrassed by the way it conducted itself and will take immediate action to improve their customer service and communication with their traveling clients.

I will be expecting your response with full reimbursement for our tickets within a week of receipt of this letter.

Sincerely, 

Linda Graham

973,complaintsboard.com,"This letter is being crafted to express the indignation and horrendous event that took place at the Santa Barbara Amtrak Station on 209 State St, Santa Barbara, CA 93101. My family and I were traveling back home to Riverside, CA on Sunday, November 10, 2019 when the incident happened. While waiting for my train to depart around 11:15 am a child around the age of 5 or 6 was with her mother and she needed to use the bathroom. The small child was sitting in the waiting area moving around on the bench because she needed to use the bathroom. The mother noticed that the bathroom required a code in order to access the restroom. The mother went to ask the front desk attendant for the code so her child could use the restroom. The lady came back to where her daughter was sitting and informed her daughter the lady would not give her the code because she was not able to present her Amtrak train ticket. The child was weeping and squirming on the train stations bench because she needed to use the bathroom urgently. I went to the front counter and asked the attendant (Rosa Noriega) for the bathroom code and presented my ticket. I received the bathroom code and opened the door for the child and her mother so the child could use the bathroom. 
The window attendant (Rosa Noriega) storms from behind the ticket counter and approaches me in an irate and infuriated manor, stating ""Do you think I'm stupid, do you think that I am [censored]ing stupid."" ""I saw what you just did."" ""It's not your job to open the door for passengers."" I told the lady ""the child needed to use the bathroom and I was not going to let her use the bathroom on herself because her mother was not able to present her ticket."" The women approached me and began yelling and screaming in my face and threatened to call the police on me and my family and to cancel our train tickets home. I told Rosa that she needed to back up and get out of my face and she would not disrespect me and talk to me in the manner that she was. Rosa continued to threaten me, putting her finger into my face and into my chest. I backed up from the women to avoid physical contact and she began to move closer connecting her chest with mine. I told the attendant to call the police because she had become uncontrollable and unruly. During this time, the other passengers that were in the lobby had become fearful because of the altercation had gotten out of hand and unpredictable. The small child and her mother hid behind the door bathroom because they did not know if the woman was going to attack them for going into the bathroom. 
As stated in the first paragraph I was traveling with my family which included my sister who is 18 and my daughter who is four years old. My daughter and my sister were in fear because of the verbal altercation and the physical contact the Rosa made with me. I began calling the police and Rosa walked away back to her ticket window. After the lady walked away, I spoke with the Amtrak Police officer who was on duty at the sight and expressed to him what happen inside the station. He made it clear to me that this is an ongoing issue with this specific employee and her supervisor. He expressed that passengers complain daily in regard to the lack of customer service and degrading interactions that are experienced at this station by this particular person and her supervisor never addressing the problems. I filed a report with the Amtrak Police officer and with the local police department. Santa Barbara City Police were called out to the scene because I was verbally and physically assaulted by this Amtrak employee. In addition, everyone in the lobby waiting for there train were in fear and my four-year-old daughter and sister who were traveling with me at the time. I am exercising my right to file charges on this employee, and I will be contacting Amtrak headquarters and I am considering filing a lawsuit against Amtrak after being attacked by one of their employees in front of my child. I will be contacting all Santa Barbara's local officials, so they are aware for the poor experiences their tourist are experiencing. No passenger, customer or citizen anywhere should ever have to endure the verbal and physical abuse I have witnessed in Santa Barbara at the Amtrak station while traveling with my family. While at this station I witnessed nothing but degrading, demeaning, and humiliating interactions amongst the customers by Amtrak employees. From the window attendants to the supervisors who are in charge. No one is present to help or resolve any questions or concerns that take place while visiting this station. 
I am highly disappointed in the overall environment and customer service that is demonstrated at the station. I should not have to travel with my family and be attacked for allowing a child to use the bathroom. I should also not have to travel with my child and have her in fear because a woman attacked her mother at the train station. I will continue to escalate this matter until this issue is resolved and it never happens to another passenger, not just at the Santa Barbara location but any Amtrak location. This company should be ashamed to call themselves America's Railroad if their passengers and families are being disrespected and verbally abused while traveling. To hire people of an angry and aggressive nature says a lot about your company's morals and how they value the people who use this service.

On 9/23/19, my girlfriend Carmen Nelson and I took the SW Chief from Los Angeles to Chicago and then the Wolverine from Chicago to Pontiac arriving on around 1 AM on 9/25/19.

Our experience on the Chief was a bit out of the ordinary and left us with quite a bad feeling about traveling by Amtrak again. First of all, there were 2 young children who were sitting across from us who demanded our attention so much that after the first night we had to request to move. The parents were in the seats in front of us and all they did was give those kids cookies which sugared them out and made them even more hyper and needy for our attention all night long. Cute kids, but they never let up needing and wanting our attention more than they wanted the attention of their parents. The conductor put us on the lower level in a much more peaceful area which made us happy.

Our second day was better downstairs and we slept better.

But in the morning on the third day after having breakfast in the dining car, when we returned to our new seats, the 2 ladies across from us reported that our seats had an electrical burst of flame (fast fireball) and sparks coming from right about where my girlfriends head would have been if we had not been at breakfast! No joke, this was ""shocking"" to say the least and the conductor told us to move to another seat. The ladies said that a train employee had been fiddling with a breaker during the time of this incident. The rest of our ride to Chicago was fear filled and apprehensive. And we feel we need some explanation as to what happened in our seating area.

The ride from Chicago to Pontiac was normal and we detrained and went on about our vacation which included my 50 high school reunion.

I feel you need to know about this and what happened to us and possibly let us in on what really happed to our seating area.

I am writing this email / letter in an effort to strongly express my dis-satisfaction with the service and customer support my wife and I experienced on our recent journey from West Coast to East Coast and back again on Amtrak trains.

We left Portland, Oregon in early July this year (2019) heading to Boston to see our son. It was, my realized after our travels were completed, the best of the journeys we encountered.

The ""porter"" David was attentive and pleasant and always made us feel ""at home."" However, when we dis-embarked in Albany (because the tracks were ""under repair"" and the train could not take us to our final Boston destination) the reps were anything but. AMTRAK, in its wisdom, informed us the last ""leg"" of our journey from Albany to Boston would be by bus but failed to email us ""confirmation"" of same the people in charge in Albany refused to let us on the bus. After 15 minutes of numerous phone calls, the man in charge simply said, ""get on…I don't care anymore"" and off we went on a 5-hour ride. This was, we were assured to be a deluxe bus…but it was anything but. Cramped seats, a small packet of nuts, a small paper container of water and no toilet for a 5-hour ride? Then with each stop, the driver announced that we were not allowed to get off the bus, that it was a brief stop *(only to witness it as a smoke break for the driver and helper) then back on the bus until we arrived at Boston south station around 8PM.

I will ignore the delays on the 2nd round of travel from Boston to Chicago…I understand, they do occur.

BUT…on the Zephyr from Omaha to Sacramento! A 2-hour delay (leaving at 11PM - didn't until 1:00AM). The porter (Curtis) greeted us at the door, put our bags on to the train then pointed the way to way we could store them…
- He made up the beds, tore them down…and we never saw 
saw him again.
- Car 0531, room 15…a family bedroom…paid for a private
toilet. Didn't get it. 
- FREEZING! To which Curtis responded, ""Hmm…well I
couldn't get it cool yesterday."" And the following day, we
were told ""Well, you're in the biggest room, move about."" 
- 1 electrical plug in this age of electronics? Really? 
- And no WIFI? 
The room was dirty…
trash in the bin and receptacles next to the beds were not removed;
footprints on the walls as though we were in a hotel were the [censored]s brought their ""johns""; 
duct tape used to repair the upper berth ""floor"" and keep it attached; 
air conditioning vents that had not been cleaned since Coolidge was President; 
a drill bit found on the floor because we stepped on it
the toilets were filthy, soap dispensers leaking; [censored] caked on the sides of the bowl, water on the floor
And we're paying $2000 for this journey to Sacramento?

On the Coast Starlight to Portland;
- boarded at midnight & our porter Dan greeted us, put our 
bags on to the train and pointed to a spot where we had to
store them.
- Our roomette was satisfactory but again, the air 
conditioning kept the room at an uncomfortable 
temperature (too cold!) with no way to modify it
- $23.00 for a steak dinner? $39.00 for steak & lobster?
AMTRAK is government subsidized - these kinds of prices
are outrageous! It matters not that as ""sleeper car"" patrons 
we were not charged but then to be expected to tip these 
employees who did nothing but their job? The only one 
who smiled and paid attention to us was Javon ( a waiter )
and therefore the only one who deserved a tip (and he got 
one!)

So, $3500 (approx) from Boston to Portland and this is the kind of service we were provided.

To say I am dis-satisfied is an understatment.

Do not say you're sorry because you're not. You're AMTRAK and You don't care.

The very least you can do is offer me a 1-way (NOT round trip!) anywhere in the US, open-ended ticket for 2 people in a 1-bedroom to make up for your terrible service…but you won't do that, will you? No. Because you will determine that I am a kook, a dis-agreeable customer who will never be content, one of thousands who travel on AMTRAK and ""love"" it.

Well, this is the 2nd time I've taken the train cross country AND back again and I can tell you, it will be the last!

No, you will remain in business…bilking the poor sons-of-[censored]es out of their hard-earned dough for many years to come and not giving one good god-damned for their comfort to making a pleasant trip.

Just know I am no longer a fan….and, here's the most important point: I will let everyone I know what I think about your trains, your people, your service, you attitude…and there isn't a damned thing you can do about that.

Thanks for a ""grand"" time.","to whom it may concern

First the ticket was for 30 of July but the Amtrak train was so late (5 hours) that I had to change the day to the 31st. No one could explain why the delay. On the return home was a nightmare, because the train attendant ( the one outside getting the tickets) was very rude and impolite, send me to the wrong car, and when I've Questioned her about the situation she said "" can you not read?"". I knew that I was going to a sleeper car with my 3 years old child and I have disability (but I can read and speak 4 languages) but did not know which car to go. I wish I had her name to tell you but I was so perplexed about her comment that I forgot to read her name tag. The train was so hot and the air conditioner was not working in my room, Jason said he was going to take care but did not. Jason was polite and helpful with my luggage and I tipped him well. I always take the train to Dallas and it is pleasant most of the time to travel by train, my whole family loves it, and the kids adore the trip. We are planning a long trip to North West with my family but I am concerned about it. I think when you pay for the service you should get it, and if you work with costumers you need to at least have a good attitude and politeness if not a smile. Ive lost a day of my my vacation, and had my feelings hurt and a massive back and head pain, ( the car that caries people to the train was full so I had to walk with my grandson in a 100 degrees Dallas heat). I know that people are not perfect but I do not like disrespect. The food was not edible on the return trip, but delicious on the departure. Member # [protected] / Reservation # D891A4 /Ticket # [protected] Sincerely Doris Paranhos","i've got tickets from little rock to dallas, departure on the 31 of july and returning on the 7 of august 2019. first the ticket was for 30 of july but the amtrak train was so late (5 hours) that i had to change the day to the 31st. no one could explain why the delay. on the return home was a nightmare, because the train attendant ( the one outside getting the tickets) was very rude and impolite, send me to the wrong car, and when i've questioned her about the situation she said "" can you not read?"". i knew that i was going to a sleeper car with my 3 years old child and i have disability (but i can read and speak 4 languages) but did not know which car to go. i wish i had her name to tell you but i was so perplexed about her comment that i forgot to read her name tag. the train was so hot and the air conditioner was not working in my room, jason said he was going to take care but did not. jason was polite and helpful with my luggage and i tipped him well. i always take the train to dallas and it is pleasant most of the time to travel by train, my whole family loves it, and the kids adore the trip. we are planning a long trip to north west with my family but i am concerned about it. i think when you pay for the service you should get it, and if you work with costumers you need to at least have a good attitude and politeness if not a smile. ive lost a day of my my vacation, and had my feelings hurt and a massive back and head pain, ( the car that caries people to the train was full so i had to walk with my grandson in a 100 degrees dallas heat). i know that people are not perfect but i do not like disrespect. the food was not edible on the return trip, but delicious on the departure. member # [protected] / reservation # d891a4 /ticket # [protected] sincerely doris paranhos","[""i've"", 'got', 'tickets', 'little', 'rock', 'dallas,', 'departure', '31', 'july', 'returning', '7', 'august', '2019.', 'first', 'ticket', '30', 'july', 'amtrak', 'train', 'late', '(5', 'hours)', 'change', 'day', '31st.', 'one', 'could', 'explain', 'delay.', 'return', 'home', 'nightmare,', 'train', 'attendant', '(', 'one', 'outside', 'getting', 'tickets)', 'rude', 'impolite,', 'send', 'wrong', 'car,', ""i've"", 'questioned', 'situation', 'said', '""', 'read?"".', 'knew', 'going', 'sleeper', 'car', '3', 'years', 'old', 'child', 'disability', '(but', 'read', 'speak', '4', 'languages)', 'know', 'car', 'go.', 'wish', 'name', 'tell', 'perplexed', 'comment', 'forgot', 'read', 'name', 'tag.', 'train', 'hot', 'air', 'conditioner', 'working', 'room,', 'jason', 'said', 'going', 'take', 'care', 'not.', 'jason', 'polite', 'helpful', 'luggage', 'tipped', 'well.', 'always', 'take', 'train', 'dallas', 'pleasant', 'time', 'travel', 'train,', 'whole', 'family', 'loves', 'it,', 'kids', 'adore', 'trip.', 'planning', 'long', 'trip', 'north', 'west', 'family', 'concerned', 'it.', 'think', 'pay', 'service', 'get', 'it,', 'work', 'costumers', 'need', 'least', 'good', 'attitude', 'politeness', 'smile.', 'ive', 'lost', 'day', 'vacation,', 'feelings', 'hurt', 'massive', 'back', 'head', 'pain,', '(', 'car', 'caries', 'people', 'train', 'full', 'walk', 'grandson', '100', 'degrees', 'dallas', 'heat).', 'know', 'people', 'perfect', 'like', 'disrespect.', 'food', 'edible', 'return', 'trip,', 'delicious', 'departure.', 'member', '#', '[protected]', '/', 'reservation', '#', 'd891a4', '/ticket', '#', '[protected]', 'sincerely', 'doris', 'paranhos']",0.8657,0.562173913

Reservation Number - C95A4E

I am writing because, so far, I have not heard and received any pronouncement from Amtrak with regard to the accident that took place on Sunday at around 5 pm at University Park. I completely understand that it was an accident. However, I along with the other passengers were stranded for more than 3 hours waiting for Amtrak people to find a solution for us. You may not want to know this, but I had to use my own money to buy some food since it was getting late and I had no idea when they were going to rescue us. In addition, I had to go to my final destination (Carbondale) on my own since I had urgent matters to solve. Therefore, I am claiming some sort of compensation for the inconvenience caused.

Thank you for your time and support.

1023,complaintsboard.com,"I have been a member of Amtrak Guest Rewards for a number of years. My wife and I recently took the Lakeshore Limited and City of New Orleans from Syracuse, NY to Chicago, IL to New Orleans.

The first leg of our trip was uneventful. 4/13/2019 on Train 49. I woke early enough to stretch my legs in Toledo. The temperature was 38 F and there was blowing sleet in a strong wind. I was in the dining car and mentioned to the attendant, Mike, that I would like to step out. He kindly opened the door and allowed me out on the platform. I walked for a few minutes, and it felt great. Mike remained on the platform monitoring me the entire time. He must have gotten uncomfortable, but was unfailingly pleasant. He treated me as I expect to be treated, as a valued customer.

The second leg of the trip was to NOLA. 4/14/2019 on Train 59. Brian was our car attendant and was very attentive and pleasant. We spoke for a while about the 8 hour delay into Union Station for train 58. Brian stated that he was on that train, and had not slept in about 30 hours. I couldn't tell, because he was very efficient in his duties. Except for helping me with my bags. I am 68 years old and don't mind assistance. I welcome it.

There was a supper served at 9 PM in the Dining Car. There were two tables fully occupied, a table with one couple and 7 tables vacant. My wife and I sat at a vacant table and were promptly asked by the attendant to move to the table with one other couple, which we did. That left seven tables vacant.

We ate a VERY disappointing Muffaletta. Almost tasteless. And it proved to reside with me for a couple of days. The server was surly. We finished our meal. There were still seven empty tables.

Breakfast was more of the same. One table fully occupied, one with one occupant, 8 empties. We were told to join the one occupant by a server who was, to understate the case, RUDE. We waited a very long time for the meal and ended up wishing it had not come. Some sort of egg/potato/sausage dish that was not completely heated (HOT AND COLD in One Dish) and was almost inedible. We finished our coffee and left. Still 8 unoccupied tables. The server was RUDER if possible.

I should mention that we had three carryons. I carried them up the stairs, and I carried them down the stairs. The attendant was nowhere to be found.

My wife and I had paid a first class rate and were treated as steerage. And fed accordingly.

We returned on 4/20/2019 Train 58. More of the same. Our attendant greeted us, and that was the last that we saw of him.

We were informed by someone that dinner would be served at 4 pm and 5 pm and would we like to make a reservation. We chose 5 pm. We learned later that there was serving at 6 and 7 also.

Same seating as before. Forced into an occupied table while many remained empty. A chinese noodle dish so bad that we left most of it behind. Poor service and long waits.

I wanted to retire at 9 PM so I used the button in our room to call Akeen at 8:30. The light on the call remained on for a full hour. No Akeen. I went looking for him. Couldn't find him. Asked a very rude attendant in the dining car how to find him. The gentleman was less than helpful.

I returned to my car and happened to run into someone who knew Akeen's location. I found him, He said that he never heard the buzzer/signal. FINALLY in bed at 1030. An hour and a half after my desired time. We asked for extra blankets since the car was very cold. Turned out that was a great idea.

I woke and went to the sightseer car. Very cold.

Went back to my room, very cold. Could see my breath! Had to don heavy clothes. And we were still cold.

Skipped breakfast. Had no desire for rude service and/or bad food.

Arrived in to Chicago. No help with bags.

A truly miserable trip on the fabled City of New Orleans!

Our last leg was on Train 4800 on 4/21/2019. Our attendant, Kevin, actually HELPED WITH MY BAGS! He also mentioned that there was a complementary drink waiting in the diner. We went and were served by the same affable attendant from our trip out, Mike. He was friendly, courteous and allowed us to sit by ourselves, even though two other tables had room for a couple. What a nice treat!

Our train was late getting into Syracuse, so we headed to the diner to be served by Mike. Again, tables were occupied by fewer than four. Again, Mike allowed us to sit where we wished. And another surprise...the lunch was not only edible but actually tasty! I had the antipasto and my wife had chicken in sauce. Mine was delicious, hers was delicious and Mike was the perfect attendant.

The train arrived in Syracuse late. Kevin assisted me with my bags. A good trip.

I checked the dollar value of my trip. According to Amtrak's site, the round trip, from SYR to NOLA and return, with 4 bedrooms, costs over 3300.00.

I also checked airfares. A FIRST CLASS trip, on Delta, from SYR to NOLA for two costs 1500 dollars. It is shorter and according to friends who have taken the trip, much more pleasant.

A train trip is an adventure. I've never demanded that I be treated as a first class passenger, and I won't now. But I should always be treated as a valued customer. And that was severely lacking on the City of New Orleans.

Strongly suggest that you get people from the Lakeshore Limited to train people on the City of New Orleans in HOW TO TREAT PASSENGERS.

I will be very surprised if I travel Amtrak again.","i have been a member of amtrak guest rewards for a number of years. my wife and i recently took the lakeshore limited and city of new orleans from syracuse, ny to chicago, il to new orleans.

the first leg of our trip was uneventful. 4/13/2019 on train 49. i woke early enough to stretch my legs in toledo. the temperature was 38 f and there was blowing sleet in a strong wind. i was in the dining car and mentioned to the attendant, mike, that i would like to step out. he kindly opened the door and allowed me out on the platform. i walked for a few minutes, and it felt great. mike remained on the platform monitoring me the entire time. he must have gotten uncomfortable, but was unfailingly pleasant. he treated me as i expect to be treated, as a valued customer.

the second leg of the trip was to nola. 4/14/2019 on train 59. brian was our car attendant and was very attentive and pleasant. we spoke for a while about the 8 hour delay into union station for train 58. brian stated that he was on that train, and had not slept in about 30 hours. i couldn't tell, because he was very efficient in his duties. except for helping me with my bags. i am 68 years old and don't mind assistance. i welcome it.

there was a supper served at 9 pm in the dining car. there were two tables fully occupied, a table with one couple and 7 tables vacant. my wife and i sat at a vacant table and were promptly asked by the attendant to move to the table with one other couple, which we did. that left seven tables vacant.

we ate a very disappointing muffaletta. almost tasteless. and it proved to reside with me for a couple of days. the server was surly. we finished our meal. there were still seven empty tables.

breakfast was more of the same. one table fully occupied, one with one occupant, 8 empties. we were told to join the one occupant by a server who was, to understate the case, rude. we waited a very long time for the meal and ended up wishing it had not come. some sort of egg/potato/sausage dish that was not completely heated (hot and cold in one dish) and was almost inedible. we finished our coffee and left. still 8 unoccupied tables. the server was ruder if possible.

i should mention that we had three carryons. i carried them up the stairs, and i carried them down the stairs. the attendant was nowhere to be found.

my wife and i had paid a first class rate and were treated as steerage. and fed accordingly.

we returned on 4/20/2019 train 58. more of the same. our attendant greeted us, and that was the last that we saw of him.

we were informed by someone that dinner would be served at 4 pm and 5 pm and would we like to make a reservation. we chose 5 pm. we learned later that there was serving at 6 and 7 also.

same seating as before. forced into an occupied table while many remained empty. a chinese noodle dish so bad that we left most of it behind. poor service and long waits.

i wanted to retire at 9 pm so i used the button in our room to call akeen at 8:30. the light on the call remained on for a full hour. no akeen. i went looking for him. couldn't find him. asked a very rude attendant in the dining car how to find him. the gentleman was less than helpful.

i returned to my car and happened to run into someone who knew akeen's location. i found him, he said that he never heard the buzzer/signal. finally in bed at 1030. an hour and a half after my desired time. we asked for extra blankets since the car was very cold. turned out that was a great idea.

i woke and went to the sightseer car. very cold.

went back to my room, very cold. could see my breath! had to don heavy clothes. and we were still cold.

skipped breakfast. had no desire for rude service and/or bad food.

1031,complaintsboard.com,"On 11/30/2018 the Amtrak train 505 departed PDX at 6:05 pm as scheduled.
It proceeded to the only scheduled stop at Oregon City, where we encountered a broken down Amtrak 508 going the opposite direction.
We then spent the next 1.5 hours sitting and going nowhere. It took another 2 hours for Amtrak to make a decision to tow the 508 back to PDX with our train 500, 20 miles away. It then took another hour to connect. It took another hour to get back to PDX. Train 500 then backed up and we sat another hour. 500 switched tracks and finally headed towards our original destination, 6 hours after the scheduled departure.

Not once during the entire delay did Amtrak offer passengers to get off of the train. Why wasn't there a bus alternative offered? We could have found our own ride to our destination! Salem is only 45 miles from Portland.
Ultimately, Amtrak kept all 93 passengers on 500 and ? on 508 hostage, unnecessarily! There should have been another non-passenger engine tow the broken 508 back to PDX. 
I agree, we did eventually get to Salem, nearly 7 hours later. Unacceptable! 
You have one job to do, transport paying passengers, and you don't do that very well at times. 
There were several poor decisions during this adventure.

At the very least, a complimentary travel voucher should be offered to every guest.

we then spent the next 1.5 hours sitting and going nowhere. it took another 2 hours for amtrak to make a decision to tow the 508 back to pdx with our train 500, 20 miles away. it then took another hour to connect. it took another hour to get back to pdx. train 500 then backed up and we sat another hour. 500 switched tracks and finally headed towards our original destination, 6 hours after the scheduled departure.

not once during the entire delay did amtrak offer passengers to get off of the train. why wasn't there a bus alternative offered? we could have found our own ride to our destination! salem is only 45 miles from portland.
ultimately, amtrak kept all 93 passengers on 500 and ? on 508 hostage, unnecessarily! there should have been another non-passenger engine tow the broken 508 back to pdx. 
i agree, we did eventually get to salem, nearly 7 hours later. unacceptable! 
you have one job to do, transport paying passengers, and you don't do that very well at times. 
there were several poor decisions during this adventure.

at the very least, a complimentary travel voucher should be offered to every guest.

Train number 49 & 3 : train from New York to Chicago to Flagstaff
Our cabin number 4911 A . A sleeper cabin has a couple of issues that could not be rectified and for us unacceptable. ( Yes we are accepting of the situation as we don't wish to make James' life he'll in continueing to complain when he can not improve the situation to our satisfaction.)
A). The bathroom - toilet would not flush. My husband did number two's and it would not flush, we added extra water from the shower hoping that would help, it did a bit but not really there was still stuff left that wouldn't go down. We spoke to our carriage butler James - who was absolutely terrific, he tried but he is not a plumber. We believe that there's a leak or displacement in the suction hose. We were asked if we wanted to change cabins to a smaller cabin, we chose not to as we felt it was way too small for us, plus the $ we paid. Later in the evening (after 11:00pm) there was a consistent buzz in the speaker/vent above the storage rack above the hand basin that could not be stopped. We packed a backpack and blanket however it only reduced it a little. 
This, and the food offered for dinner (nothing short of a disgrace) is way short of our expectations of Amtrak. We were told by Americans that the trip that we're booked on is magic and we'd love the service... not sure about that...yes this is our first leg of three - New York to Chicago -res 839414, Chicago to Flagstaff res 839414, Flagstaff to Los Angeles - res 83947E. At this rate we can only complement our butler James - he's fantastic, a wonderful man with a sense of humour, very caring and loves his work.

Now the second leg of our journey is complete - Chicago to Flagstaff res 839414, toilet problems in our sleeper cabin again. This time the fresh water that rinses the bowl continually filled then overflowed. You had to flush the toilet every few minutes so that it wouldn't overflow. Paul, our new butler, did all that he could, but it took some 2 hours before he could turn off the cold water. This meant that the bowl could not be rinsed, you could not use the shower as no cold to temper the hot. The floor outside (carpet) ended up quite wet. The maintenance is ridiculous on these sleeper carriages, cost reduction is one thing but when it causes major discomfort to your clients it's another.

Our train was 4.5 hrs late into Chicago, which meant the sight seeing activities that we booked had to be thrown away as we had less than half an hour before our train Flagstaff was to leave. Staff were apologising as they had run out of food and could only offer tea and coffee, albeit with no milk/creamer as they'd run out of that. You guys have to get your act together.

The third leg was relatively uneventful, we just couldn't sleep very well due to the room dividing door rattling sooo much. We tried to stuff it, we succeeded a little but it was near impossible to sleep.

I know that we will never travel Amtrak again, let alone consider adding it to any of our plans. This experience (and it's cost) has made us realise that Amtrak are cost cutting far too far. You need to fix your trains to make the sleeper mode attractable. We also know that this email will be shoved aside and ignored, but you need to know the customer issues.

I pity how some of these people clean their house! Then the people using their cell phones after hours and after the conductor made reference to if they speak on their cells go to the bar car.

A baby crying for 24 hours was nerve racking..

Then the most startling experience was the very obnoxious and racist person that was screaming obnoxious statements ( to the conductors and his traveling partner was the worst thing one can witness, he was also very verbally abusive and the conductors did nothing to diffuse the situation. We All felt unsafe, in danger and I've been traveling Amtrak since 2013, traveling up north, but after that experience I am exploring traveling in the future another way, flying anything but that train.

* Back to the Disgusting bathrooms: Traveling on Amtrak one needs to feel safe, the female conductor with neck problems did her best, but after she would clean up, then people resorting to urinating on the floors, this was very unsanitary. Might I suggest a person needs to be assigned to that position mainly to clean the bathrooms especially on long train rides from West Palm Beach Florida to NY.

I am sure many will complain about this service and I feel as if a refund and or we should be compensated with a round trip ticket to make up for our terrible treatment..

The seats in this car were brutally uncomfortable - no padding, no way to adjust the position of the seat back (there was a level that looked like it would, but pressing on it did nothing, some mean trick). The seat was so high up my feet didn't touch the floor. I tried putting my travel bag under my feet, and my feet barely touched that, so it did not at all relieve the pressure on the backs of my thighs & knees. When I told the conductor the seat was uncomfortable, he said, he knew, and added that these seats are smaller. I said, ""I'm small and they weren't even comfortable for me."" (I am 5'2"" - not freakishly small, I should be able to touch the floor) He said, ""Well they have more leg room"" I said, ""I noticed when my feet didn't reach the floor."" He then said the car was a ""European design"". But I have ridden trains in Europe, long distance, subway and street cars, and never encountered such uncomfortable seats. He said that he wished the seats were the worse problem with these cars, but stopped himself and refused to elaborate - which makes me EXTREMELY concerned they may have safety issues.

When I went into the bathroom, I found that the grab bar was installed so low that it was across the toilet seat lid, so that lid could not be moved from an upright position, and could not be lowered before flushing the toilet (on a moving train - gross!)

At least 3 things need to be done: 1. The company(or companies) that designed and manufactured these cars must be held to account. The replacement of these seats must be at their expense. (In the meantime, the humane thing to do would be to put foot rests in these cars) 2. The grab bar/toilet seat lid situation must be addressed. 3. These cars should be investigated immediately for other more serious issues.

My request is to be compensated for train delay and to request that Amtrak info customers a realistic time frame for delays and not string us along. I was going to DC and did not want to travel in the inclement weather, I understand that mother nature had a major part in the delay. Tell me that it will take over 5 hrs and I'd make other arrangements.
Amtrak left me confused, exhausted, weak and scared

i headed to the train platform around 7pm. once on the train platform, i noticed an alert from#1 amtrak @ 6:56pm that train 0066 delayed est arrival now 8:56pm. the message added to pleas arrive 30 minutes prior to board train. well i waited on the platform.
#2 train 0066, delayed est arrival 9:06pm, arrive 30 minutes prior to departure
#3 train 0066, delayed est arrival 9:35pm, arrive 30 minutes prior to departure.
#4 train 0066, delayed est arrival 10:05pm, arrive 30minutes prior to departure.
#5 train 0066, delayed est arrival 10:35pm, arrive 30 minutes prior to departure.
#6 train 0066, delayed est arrival 11:05pm, arrive 30 minutes prior to departure.

#10 train 0066, delayed est arrival 1:05 am """"
#11 train 0066, delayed est arrival 1:21am ""'
i found out that a tree fall in a nearby city and work was needed to remove.
however, i still received amtrak alerts
#12 train 0066, delayed est arrival 1:32am, arrive 30 minutes prior to departure.
at this point, i returned to my car and waited. i made a few calls to nearby friends who suggested i call police if i felt scared.
i made several trips from my car to the fredericksburg train platform with my luggage in the rain. at this point, i was the only passenger boarding train # 0066.
the local bar had closed, leaving the area where i parked dark and desolate. as fear sat in, i called the non emergency city police dept.
#13 train 0066, delayed est 1:56am, arrive 30 minutes prior to departure.
#14 train 0066, delayed, est 2:21am"" ""
#15 train 0066 delayed, est 2:36am,"" ""
#16 train 0066 delayed, est 3:16am
police arrived and requested i move my vehicle to a available parking area nearest the amtrak platform. i moved my car where the office suggested. upon my return from out of town, i was welcomed with a $25 parking ticket (parking in a permitted area without a permit!
train 0066 arrived at 3:45am

my request is to be compensated for train delay and to request that amtrak info customers a realistic time frame for delays and not string us along. i was going to dc and did not want to travel in the inclement weather, i understand that mother nature had a major part in the delay. tell me that it will take over 5 hrs and i'd make other arrangements.
amtrak left me confused, exhausted, weak and scared

your assistance in this matter will be mostly appreciated.

My time on coach was fair. My time in lower level was dreadful. The car was filth, black mold on the air vents. Difficult to get to food facility.

1055,complaintsboard.com,"I am Maryland resident and recently traveled to New York City on 3/19/2018 via Amtrak, and would be continued to Boston on 3/21/2018 for an interview on 3/22/2018 afternoon. I purchased airplane ticket flying back to DC after the interview on 3/22. Unfortunately, my 3/21 Amtrak train was canceled. I rescheduled the train to 3/22 morning. However, my 3/22 train was canceled again. Since I had no opportunity to catch up my interview on 3/22, there was no need for me to go to Boston, so I had to re-reschedule my trip back to Maryland on 3/22 late night.

What I complaining here is about an Amtrak agent I worked with on 3/22 in rescheduling my trip back to Maryland. The agent treated me very impatient and rudely: first she refused to reschedule my trip back to Maryland because I changed the destination. I explained to her that due to the Amtrack's back-to-back cancellation that 100% abolished my Boston trip, I don't need to go to Boston but go back to Maryland. Second, she insisted that I need to pay the charge for the difference (172 Amtrack award points). I asked if she could be so kind as to waiver the 172-point charge since this amtrak's back-to-back cancellation had made me pay one extra night hotel cost in NYC and my pre-purchased airplane ticket from Boston to Maryland which is non-refundable. The agent rudely denied my request saying that the cancellation was not Amtrak's fault. Come on, I had paid extra couple hundred dollars for the Boston trip due to the back-to-back cancellation, and 172 Amtrak Award points are less than $5 in value, why not Amtrak be responsible for this little cost for the cancellations, even after a customer requested for this? During the process, the agent put me in waiting for 5-6 times without an explanation! I purchased for Amtrak's services, but what I received was my trip was abolished, I had to pay extra money for nothing, and I was treated as problematic instead of a customer. I kept calm and asked the agent if I could talk to her supervisor, but she rejected my request again. The agent's rudeness, impatientness, unprofessionalism, and unethical behavior seriously hurt me as a loyal Amtrak customer.

i wish to be compensated for the thief of my luggage due to the fact that it is part of a match set. and the cost of dry cleaning all my clothes that were in the old dirty black bag. i do not know what was in the suitcase prior to someone throwing my belongings in it. i had 5 pairs of slacks, 3 sweaters, 4 shirts, 1 small jacket and other various personal belongings.","['return', 'trip', 'silver', 'meteor', '97,', 'leaving', 'dc', 'nov', '25', 'arriving', 'nov', '26', 'deerfield', 'beach,', 'fl.', 'checked', 'red', 'suitcase', 'dc', 'station', 'pick', 'destination', 'florida.', 'upon', 'arrival', 'suitcase', 'there.', 'spoke', 'employee,', 'orlando', 'sr,', 'luggage', 'train.', 'one', 'suitcase', 'black.', 'stated', 'deerfield', 'station', 'check', 'luggage.', 'told', 'checked', 'dc', 'told', 'would', 'deerfield', 'beach.', 'politely', 'told', 'would', 'check', 'train', 'already', 'pulling', 'out.', 'told', 'tag/id', 'suitcase', 'would', 'lost.', 'explained', 'asked', 'wanted', 'check', 'black', 'bag', 'see', 'mine?', 'ask', 'see', 'luggage', 'receipt', 'showed', 'him,', 'would', 'give', 'receipt', 'back', 'me.', 'kept', 'asking', 'open', 'black', 'suitcase', 'see', 'items', 'suitcase?', 'one', 'station', 'claiming', 'black', 'bag.', 'proceeded', 'open', 'suitcase', 'lo', 'behold,', 'clothing', 'shoes', 'black', 'suitcase.', 'sudden', 'hand', 'written', 'tag', 'filled', 'beginning', 'trip', 'hand', 'stating', 'tag', 'suitcase.', 'first', 'said', 'tag/id', 'suitcase.', 'red', 'suitcase', 'locked', 'trip', 'maybe', 'someone', 'thought', 'valuables', 'wanted', 'red', 'suitcase,', 'know.', 'wish', 'compensated', 'thief', 'luggage', 'due', 'fact', 'part', 'match', 'set.', 'cost', 'dry', 'cleaning', 'clothes', 'old', 'dirty', 'black', 'bag.', 'know', 'suitcase', 'prior', 'someone', 'throwing', 'belongings', 'it.', '5', 'pairs', 'slacks,', '3', 'sweaters,', '4', 'shirts,', '1', 'small', 'jacket', 'various', 'personal', 'belongings.']",0.3434,0.395333333

1062,complaintsboard.com,"I traveled from Springfield, IL to Milwaukee, WI in June. There were a number of issues with the trip, but here's my main complaint:

During the train portion of our trip, I visited the dining car with two other friends. I bought yogurt and a muffin, paid with a debit card. I wasn't given a receipt, and didn't think to ask for one since I was TOLD the charge would be for around $6.50. I also purchased a water, separately, with cash.

When I reached my room that night, I checked my bank account to verify the amount I would have for shopping the next night. To my surprise I noticed a $65 transaction from the Amtrak Cafe! I was shocked. I had purchased my ticket more than a month ago, and hadn't charged anything else at/on Amtrak that day, so I knew the charge had to be for my muffin.

I called Amtrak the next day, and was transferred from one department to another. I finally got a person who could help, and was told some BS story about how they don't handle refunds there, but she would forward my complaint to their refund department, and see what they said. She called me back the next day and said that they were going to look into it, and that it could take up to 20 DAYS to get my refund. Note that this was a debit card transaction, so it was my cash that they had, not credit. I had put a specific amount of money into my account for this trip. Because of this $65 charge, I ended up overdrafting. I was charged almost $70 in overdraft fees.

I contacted my bank (Chase) and explained the situation. They were nice about it, and immediately refunded all the overdraft fees, and I deposited some of the cash I had on hand to bring my account back to a positive balance. This wiped out all but my emergency funds for my trip. I had my husband transfer money from another account so that I had enough money on hand to eat.

Two days after I returned to Springfield, I received a call at 8 AM informing me that Amtrak had no records of the transaction, and therefore couldn't refund any money. They recommended I report it as a fraudulent transaction to my bank. I thought this was ridiculous, but followed the CS rep's (the same one I had dealt with from the beginning) suggestion and reported the transaction through the Chase fraud department.

Today (July 31st), well over a month past when I reported this to Chase, and almost two months since the original issue, I was informed by Chase that Amtrak provided documentation proving that this was not a fraudulent charge. Apparently it's only fraud if you never had any contact what-so-ever with the merchant. This the the SAME paperwork that they 'couldn't find' that required me to report the claim as fraud in the first place!

Message: On Aug 23rd I took a trip from Redmond OR to LA Ca. two days before my departure, reservation # 66B1B. a Debbie from Amtrak cs called to tell me my seating may have been booked wrong and I may or my service dog, may not have a seat reserved... (even though I booked and paid for this months ago and had received my tickets and called and double checked reservation...) She called back later to tell me every thing is ok.. and I would have no problems. why did she just not take care of this instead of worrying me and those who this affected? There were so many problems this trip, I will just list problems not in a story mode. So it won't read easy however there were so many problems that this will be easiest. I got to the train station in Chemult oregon ( you bussed me from Redmond to Chemult) and caught the train. Things went great, service was awesome, air condition broke, so we roasted...literally as there are no windows to open for fresh air even.. We were told sorry if we turn on your ac the upstairs gets too cold, if we turn it off, you roast, they let us roast. they did open the car door but bathrooms do not smell nice and the noise from slamming doors from passengers at all hours, No wifi like we were told. but conductor announced stops and when ok to get off and commentated on scenery. It was great. then in San Diego we hit a person on the tracks, that delayed us 3 hours. It was at this time we were told there were vips on the train and they may be coming around to see how service is ( which explained the great ride and service up to that point) unfortunately they got off the train and it was obvious... we were delayed another 1.5 hours making us over 5 hours late into la. ( I do not hold the suicide as amtraks fault but the additional 1.5 hours of delay definitely was ( twice we were stopped for another amtrak train announced, and once delayed for inspection.) I guess amtrak felt we were already so late what did it matter if we were later? Not happy!

Then I returned on Sept 3rd that trip was a nightmare! To start with they tried separating me from my service dog. Several employees were rude to me about my dog making comments to other passengers. I said NO! you are not separating us.. ( which is illegal amtrak ada would be very interested in this.) then they told all to take a seat. I did and took a seat that had plenty of floor space for my service dog, faced the direction train was moving so I would not get sick, the car attendant came up to me and rudely said, cover the seat with a blanket if your dog gets on it, I said she is trained to stay on the floor, close but out of the way.(I found out later why he said that) He left. the air conditioning did not work again. so they left the car door open and unfortunately the bathrooms were close. the chemicals from the toilets literally burned my eyes..I have a medical condition which causes severe chemical sensitivities, let alone the smoking in the bathroom made breathing difficult. the constant noise from the slamming of doors was ridiculous! Our attendants were not that observant, nor did they come down very often. the attendants and others used our cabin at stops to put extra luggage in so if we had an emergency the disabled cabin door would have been blocked by fallen luggage and we would have been trapped inside car. The conductor did not announce smoke stops ( I do not smoke however that is the only times I can take my service dog out to do her business)about 12:30am at Sacramento our cabin attendant came in and ordered me to move to seat 81 and 82 which was so small you could not stretch out your legs literally only knee room, and my service dog could not fit between seat and wall laying down let alone sitting up ( it was facing wall)so she had to sit on the seat which took up most of both seats ( as she is trained to lay down out of the way) so I had to literally put my legs on her and with ac out that made it hotter and very dangerous as I could not get out of my seat hardly, others had to help me out as I had to sit on my dog to get out. - it was like time out punishment in a corner. Those should NOT be seats! I asked why as there were 4 other people in the car that had two seats for one person and plenty of floor space.. He made me move anyway. he did offer to turn the seat around but there was lots of luggage in that space so I would have had to deal with that and still had no floor space, and ride backwards. the other people laid down on two seats and went to sleep, including the lady that he gave my seat to. After he left, I got up with help pulling me up on top of my dog and stood or sat on stairs to upstairs in the on off door space until 2:30 am when another woman attendant came down. I told her look where me and my dog were ""seated"" we can not fit. She went inside, shook her head and woke everyone up to move us around giving me a seat this time where I had to ride backwards ( my original seat I did not because I get severe motion sickness and backwards riding does not help at all.) He put a Kathy H. in this small seat, she too is filing a complaint. the woman who took my seat apologized I told her I did not want kicked out in the middle of the night as amtrak has done if a person complains too much. she said I should not have moved. this cabin door had still not been fixed so the smell of urine and feces was overwhelming at this point . and the door open constantly allowed the mothers with screaming kids to come downstairs and into our cabin and let the kids scream and any one who wanted downstairs for what ever reason to be in the disabled car, many other women were not happy about this esp when men who caused problems and said things came in. finally door fixed then broke again, others came in and once the attendant said a man who was not disabled, could not sit there he said one more stop two hours away so he let him stay, this guy got up and tugged on door one of the other women shouted at him to leave it alone.. where was the attendant? he really busted the door now again trying to get it to close. they finally got it to close but by then the smell was so bad it made no difference, feces and urine, horrid! I could not even order food. ( which when we ordered yesterday the attendant after telling us not to forget his $10 tip, informed us the menu prices were not correct, I said that was your tip sorry... when we were not charged the menu price. Also one of the other passengers who had a wheelchair, not only got front row room for his chair but got two front facing seats to sit in on the trip, he informed me he was going from Sacramento ca to Birmingham Alabama in a sleeper car for 3 nights for $361.00 I got told for one night from oregon to ca $601.00 he showed me his ticket so verified it. he also got an additional 15% discount off his disabled ticket for having a public disabled pass ( which I also have) but I was not given and additional discount. Why the huge difference? 601.00 is ridiculous for a roomette he got a handicap room... and all his meals included. Also amtrak is supposed to give me reward points for all my train trips I have NEVER got mine and emailed numerous times still nothing or no response.

Comp a ride from redmond oregon to la calif any time of my choosing in a handicap sleeper car... and give me the reward points I have earned.. what is sad I have many people who wanted to take a train ride cross country and were waiting for me to share my experience... you loose amtrak., 

I could not put this in a time frame (bullets) as it was whole trip!

(even though i booked and paid for this months ago and had received my tickets and called and double checked reservation...) she called back later to tell me every thing is ok.. and i would have no problems. why did she just not take care of this instead of worrying me and those who this affected? there were so many problems this trip, i will just list problems not in a story mode. so it won't read easy however there were so many problems that this will be easiest. i got to the train station in chemult oregon ( you bussed me from redmond to chemult) and caught the train. things went great, service was awesome, air condition broke, so we roasted...literally as there are no windows to open for fresh air even.. we were told sorry if we turn on your ac the upstairs gets too cold, if we turn it off, you roast, they let us roast. they did open the car door but bathrooms do not smell nice and the noise from slamming doors from passengers at all hours, no wifi like we were told. but conductor announced stops and when ok to get off and commentated on scenery. it was great. then in san diego we hit a person on the tracks, that delayed us 3 hours. it was at this time we were told there were vips on the train and they may be coming around to see how service is ( which explained the great ride and service up to that point) unfortunately they got off the train and it was obvious... we were delayed another 1.5 hours making us over 5 hours late into la. ( i do not hold the suicide as amtraks fault but the additional 1.5 hours of delay definitely was ( twice we were stopped for another amtrak train announced, and once delayed for inspection.) i guess amtrak felt we were already so late what did it matter if we were later? not happy!

then i returned on sept 3rd that trip was a nightmare! to start with they tried separating me from my service dog. several employees were rude to me about my dog making comments to other passengers. i said no! you are not separating us.. ( which is illegal amtrak ada would be very interested in this.) then they told all to take a seat. i did and took a seat that had plenty of floor space for my service dog, faced the direction train was moving so i would not get sick, the car attendant came up to me and rudely said, cover the seat with a blanket if your dog gets on it, i said she is trained to stay on the floor, close but out of the way.(i found out later why he said that) he left. the air conditioning did not work again. so they left the car door open and unfortunately the bathrooms were close. the chemicals from the toilets literally burned my eyes..i have a medical condition which causes severe chemical sensitivities, let alone the smoking in the bathroom made breathing difficult. the constant noise from the slamming of doors was ridiculous! our attendants were not that observant, nor did they come down very often. the attendants and others used our cabin at stops to put extra luggage in so if we had an emergency the disabled cabin door would have been blocked by fallen luggage and we would have been trapped inside car. the conductor did not announce smoke stops ( i do not smoke however that is the only times i can take my service dog out to do her business)about 12:30am at sacramento our cabin attendant came in and ordered me to move to seat 81 and 82 which was so small you could not stretch out your legs literally only knee room, and my service dog could not fit between seat and wall laying down let alone sitting up ( it was facing wall)so she had to sit on the seat which took up most of both seats ( as she is trained to lay down out of the way) so i had to literally put my legs on her and with ac out that made it hotter and very dangerous as i could not get out of my seat hardly, others had to help me out as i had to sit on my dog to get out. - it was like time out punishment in a corner. those should not be seats! i asked why as there were 4 other people in the car that had two seats for one person and plenty of floor space.. he made me move anyway. he did offer to turn the seat around but there was lots of luggage in that space so i would have had to deal with that and still had no floor space, and ride backwards. the other people laid down on two seats and went to sleep, including the lady that he gave my seat to. after he left, i got up with help pulling me up on top of my dog and stood or sat on stairs to upstairs in the on off door space until 2:30 am when another woman attendant came down. i told her look where me and my dog were ""seated"" we can not fit. she went inside, shook her head and woke everyone up to move us around giving me a seat this time where i had to ride backwards ( my original seat i did not because i get severe motion sickness and backwards riding does not help at all.) he put a kathy h. in this small seat, she too is filing a complaint. the woman who took my seat apologized i told her i did not want kicked out in the middle of the night as amtrak has done if a person complains too much. she said i should not have moved. this cabin door had still not been fixed so the smell of urine and feces was overwhelming at this point . and the door open constantly allowed the mothers with screaming kids to come downstairs and into our cabin and let the kids scream and any one who wanted downstairs for what ever reason to be in the disabled car, many other women were not happy about this esp when men who caused problems and said things came in. finally door fixed then broke again, others came in and once the attendant said a man who was not disabled, could not sit there he said one more stop two hours away so he let him stay, this guy got up and tugged on door one of the other women shouted at him to leave it alone.. where was the attendant? he really busted the door now again trying to get it to close. they finally got it to close but by then the smell was so bad it made no difference, feces and urine, horrid! i could not even order food. ( which when we ordered yesterday the attendant after telling us not to forget his $10 tip, informed us the menu prices were not correct, i said that was your tip sorry... when we were not charged the menu price. also one of the other passengers who had a wheelchair, not only got front row room for his chair but got two front facing seats to sit in on the trip, he informed me he was going from sacramento ca to birmingham alabama in a sleeper car for 3 nights for $361.00 i got told for one night from oregon to ca $601.00 he showed me his ticket so verified it. he also got an additional 15% discount off his disabled ticket for having a public disabled pass ( which i also have) but i was not given and additional discount. why the huge difference? 601.00 is ridiculous for a roomette he got a handicap room... and all his meals included. also amtrak is supposed to give me reward points for all my train trips i have never got mine and emailed numerous times still nothing or no response.

comp a ride from redmond oregon to la calif any time of my choosing in a handicap sleeper car... and give me the reward points i have earned.. what is sad i have many people who wanted to take a train ride cross country and were waiting for me to share my experience... you loose amtrak., 

i could not put this in a time frame (bullets) as it was whole trip!

1074,complaintsboard.com,"On March 3rd 12:56pm EST, I booked tickets online for a trip with Amtrak.
I realized I made an error in the dates and on March 3rd 2:39pm EST (1 hr and 43 minutes later), I called to have those dates changed.
New dates resulted in a new price (lower). I was told by the person on the phone that I would be charged the new amount and sent the correct tickets. I know this because I asked specifically.

On March 4, Fed Ex attempted to delivery my tickets. When I received the envelope (March 8), they were the wrong tickets and (after checking my bank account) I was charged the wrong amount.
I called Amtrak, spoke with 5 people, including Customer Relations.
They essentially said that the only way for me to get my money bank (difference between original booking and new booking) and get correct tickets is to:
1) go to the train station now or wait for my trip and hand in the old tickets and get the new and my money back
2) send the tickets I have back at my own expense

I told Amtrak this was unacceptable. I am not near the train station and would like my money back before my trip. I also felt that I should not have to send them back at a cost to me, as I was given (evidently) the wrong information by the person who changed my reservation.

I was told, in no uncertain terms, that Amtrak would not issue me a pre-paid envelope or provide me with a shipping account number. I was told I could mail them back with a stamp, but without delivery confirmation, there's no guarantee they'd receive them.

I suggested that Amtrak refund me the $15 charge for sending me the tickets. I thought this was a good compromise. I was then told they won't do that because, you know, they DID mail me the tickets (even though I did not think they would be mailing me the wrong ones).

Understanding this may have boiled down to a communication error on the part of the Amtrak employee who changed my reservation, I thought that the $15 fee refunded to me was a reasonable request and would allow me to then take that money and mail back the wrong tickets.

Alas, I have been told by everyone I've talked to that they won't do it, and that going to the train station (thereby leaving me out that extra money for a while) or mailing the tickets at my expense are my ONLY options.

I was told by Brandy in Customer Relations that I was free to call the corporate office if I so desired. Which I did. I left messages with Joseph Boardman (CEO/President) and Matthew Hardison (Chief, Sales Distribution and Customer Service). But I was also told by someone else in the corporate office (when I attempted to reach HR) that Amtrak was never going to part with their money.

Really? Such a small amount to make a customer happy?
And really now, this is sort of an issue about principle. Shame on you, Amtrak.

1077,complaintsboard.com,"Amtrak locks wheelchair bound passenger in train
Follows dangerous security protocol

He was trapped on a darkened train all because the conductor was in a rush to get to a party.  the lights and the engine were shut off. Amtrak's rules are straight forward-if your are disabled you are the first to de-train and red caps assist you with your belongings.

You are not locked on the train with the lights turned off left to fend for your disabled self unable to get your wheelchair off.

He was trapped and held against his will. Period.

What if he had collapsed as has a seizure condition that leaves him highly susceptible to falling? Worse he had just suffered a series of seizures and his eyesight had left him.

And security? What if this were a passenger that was intent on doing harm — he could have easily pulled off a massive disaster due to amtrak's lackadaisical excuse for security. 

We as travelers are harassed to no end, strip searched, body scanned, x-rayed, all except when the conductor or pilot has another arbitrary concern or company party to attend.

Fortunately, he was not the “t” word and was only a disabled man being tortured and kidnapped by the railroad.

The man's disabled children, a girl 6 and a boy 8, both suffering from limb girdle muscular dystrophy were waiting for him outside. The father only agreeing to what was suppose to be a momentary separation as he was promised that help was “ — seconds away.”

The ailing family was now becoming increasingly distressed over the others disappearance. What sort of thing was this to do to 3 disabled people? What would have happened if the children were abducted from the chicago station platform while the father was locked helpless on a darkened train? “by the grace of god go i” is not an appropriate standard of security for one of the world's largest traveling institutions.

Ms. Marty martin 73, was one of the many witnesses to mr. Xoss disparaging and reprehensible treatment. These were — multiple punishments — that occurred over a several day trip. Mrs. Martin suffering from sleep apnea and congestive heart failure found herself in similar situation with amtrak-as she was also left alone and abandoned. 

All facts that will not shine brightly upon amtrak's organization. Perhaps her conductor was on his way to a party too?

The disabled man did state to an amtrak that “ — it is difficult to imagine that the doj would look at such instances as anything other than a serious breach in the chain of proper security protocols and the rampant and institutionalized abuse of disabled people.”

After he complained about another inordinate wait, the red caps finally showed up. They dragged his luggage on the ground and acted incredibly irritated at the disabled family's existence. He denounced amtrak's behavior; that he was locked in the train, being the last off, separated from his children and having his bags scrapped along the ground — it was only then that the uniformed personnel demanded the disabled mans id, a disability badge which was hanging conspicuously around his neck. When he inquired as to why they would '–be asking for his id when he got off the train as opposed to getting on the train-' he was referred to 6 other employee’s who also repeatedly demanded he identify himself.

He went to file a discrimination complaint, with the chicago supervisor kathy baker, he was told he “ — had enough time to file a complaint or board the train — but not both — ”. Yet the train to los angles was over 3 hour away-he was then forced to move his own luggage-again sighting his own early arrival “ — you have to go get your own cart and move your own luggage because you are so early — ” mrs. Baker proudly proclaimed. She seemed upset that her allegation that the luggage weighed over the limit of 50lbs failed to materialize-after each and every article that the family had was weighed. He warned her that she was abusing every single amtrak rule simply as a mechanism of harassment. Additionally “ — what did weighing the bags have to do with being locked on the train? Is amtrak really allowed to lock you on the train if your bags weigh too much — and weren't you suppose to weigh the bags when you were getting on the train and not off the train?”

She sighted the fact that unruly passengers can be thrown off the train and forfeit the cost of their fare. 

The disabled father responded that he now “ — understood the rules and that if he filed a complaint his family would be stuck in chicago with no way of getting home.” 

That would be the second time that amtrak would kidnap and hold the family hostage.

After being habitually harnessed by amtrak on their journey back to los angles the family discovered that both of the 6 month old wheelchairs that had been shipped by amtrak appeared as if they were thrown off of the train. Both were smashed and unusable. The father's wheelchair was worth over $27, 000 and now was nothing more than an expensive paperweight. The other chair now only operated in reverse.

Amtrak was now using the story that the wheelchair was delivered broken as the disabled father “ — had admitted to them — ” as much. They failed to mention that the father was referring to a previous pediatric wheelchair that was delivered to the him and that he was forced to return as such a chair was useless to a grown man of nearly 6 ft and over 200 lbs. All of which is clearly documented in the family’s medical records.

Demonstration amtrak willing to what ever they need to do to get out their obligations. Apparently the railroad has to fix some way to explain how metal parts were twisted off the wheelchair.

Amtrak would have you believe that every event that took placed against the disabled man and his family were separate and individual events rather then a pattern of force, discrimination and intimidation.

Who on god's green earth is going to believe that you better start looking for the oj jury and see if their available their your one and only hope he have no fear of security tapes the transit officers held his hand, his arm and hugged him how bad he have been? 

It makes much more sense that the disabled man was wrongfully taken last off the train, locked aboard the train, improperly separated from his children, had their bags dragged across the ground, were threatened that they couldn’t get on the train if they filed a discrimination complaint, that mrs. Bakers cohort(s) intimidate and harassed the family all the way back to los angles and finally in the utter act of malicious conduct had both of their wheelchairs destroyed appearing as if not one but both were smashed by having them thrown off the train.

Anything to not fix the wheelchairs you broke!
I lost 2 jobs because of you as I have no way of getting to work or doing a job as I can not stand for long periods of time. You have helped to make me and my 2 disabled children homeless — I am living off of vouchers. Amtrak your are just bad people~!
Anderson, mark"" [protected]@amtrak.com as the administrator of this case you have become the evil enforcer of power gone wrong! Do the right thing refund my round trip fare and fix my wheelchairs! Yeah how did they both break anyway adam?

Sadly I have never gotten any mail from Amtrak I have asked for it a number of times and I was told it was sent to ""my"" address in PA.

Why would the mail be sent to PA when I clearly live in Los Angeles, Ca? Seems like a stall tactic.
 
I corrected Amtrak’s ""mistake"" and asked everything be forwarded to 9595 Wilshire Blvd #900 BH CA 90212, again sadly nothing.
It is strange and dubious as to why nothing has been neither forwarded nor mailed to me directly—I have verified it with the professional service that accepts my mail and they have confirmed that nothing has been sent to me from Amtrak. It has been recorded in their records-this is a service I have used for over 5 years. 
This situation, at the very least, sounds like a very detrimental situation for Amtrak, I remind you this is NOT my opinion but rather information provided to me by the professional mail receiving service.

I have no motive nor anything to gain by pretending I have gotten mail from Amtrak when I have not—I would strongly suggest it is quiet the opposite-- I have everything to lose by such a tactic.

 After all who cares if I don't answer you what can that possibly garner for me?

Kirby Cox and Edwin are on my DV camera and while difficult to hear it is not impossible to hear them both did admit to quite a few problems, in regard to the damage to BOTH my disability scooter as well as my wheelchair. They both went out of their way to document damage that I had not initially realize was there myself-- it was all quite shocking with the level of damage to both Chairs.

Damage that clearly shows that the most the most likely cause was a drop from a height as well as damage that would require repeated turning and deliberately twisting to create such damaged to the disability vehicles. Simply that such parts of the disability scooter and wheelchair could have only removed and damaged by repeated and deliberate twisting.
I remarked at how impressed and grateful I was at their honesty. They also commented on their lack of understanding as to why each was 'wrapped' ( I use this term in an overly generalized way) AND separately and differently AND not up to Amtrak's specifications as clearly described by Edwin.
 
Both machines were 6 months old. Both providers (not me) are very aware of their condition and documented maintenance.
 
I even went out of my way to baby my chair upon arrival from my parting port--it was very sad that no one was there to help me with both wheelchairs. I am not sure why I had no help and I was forced to move the bigger heavy wheelchair on my own ridiculous, but I was had to as my children, who are fragile need to board the train.

It will also prove unhelpful to Amtrak that both OTHER significantly older chairs look nearly new or excellent condition. Also you failed to explain and understand that both of this disability vehicles were under 6 months old and are, even to this day being paid for.

I have no motive to abuse my chair (and all records indicate the opposite) and have every reason to care for them as both of my children are disabled.
 
You further failed to address Kathy Bakers and/or the other Amtrak employees smell and behavior and my denial of my filing an ADA complaint. I am NOT referring to any internal documents nor confidentiality agreements you have with your employee (s). It is clear that the handful (5-6?) of Amtrak s personnel were acting reprehensibly and we are clearly entitled to a full refund for our horrible and abusive trip. And I continue to insist upon it.

I look forward to seeing the security tapes and beyond that I am excited as I know what happened without any additives.

They will clearly show a Chicago Transit Officer assisting me and holding my arm, my hand and giving me a hug after words-hardly images that will support any false and evil theory you might want to inject about any slanderous and defamatory negative insinuations by Amtrak about any behavior on my part. 

They will also demonstrate that all our bag were weighed, at MY insistence and the heaviest ones was 42 pound and the rest were 22 pound or less. Yes in some instances Amtrak may have followed the “rules” but they were applied in an inappropriate way and one designed to abuse and physically harm me, yes physically harm me. Disabled people should not be moving their own luggage, pushing carts being forced to march and weigh items under their own power. This is cruel and abusive; and certainly their can be no legitimate reason to have to show 7 employes in a row your ID.

I believe these acts constitute what would be equivalent to cruel and unusual punishment. I pray the security tapes are still in existence. Then this he said she said can be put in its proper place-the trash bin. There is no way you will be able to justify me having to be FORCED to doing all the above described acts. What explanation will Amtrak be able to offer? I promise you the my behavior in ALL security tapes going to and from PA will not support this false supposition that some in your employee have tried. They will document that me and my family revived many and repeated hugs and handshakes from Amtrak employees.

Hardly this unruly passenger that some have alleged—of course I must be the bad person in this situation. How can I be the good one? If I am to be deemed a good guy it brings much of Amtrak's behavior to an unmerciful verdict.
 
I am talking to more than one attorney--is this really the way this must be resolved?
 
Really?
 
I was trapped on a darkened train and all alone because the conductor was in a rush to get off.  Despite my pleas it took longer than it should have for them to get me out and turn the lights back on. It was right after I had suffered a series of seizures and my eyesight was particularly poor. I was frightened and felt like a prison on a darkened abandoned train. I was fearful I would be injury myself in the darkness having to remove two wheelchairs AGAIN on my own. Where were Amtrak employes? Even from a security point of view why was I allowed to be left on a train alone for an inappropriate period of time in the dark?

My little children, who were waiting for my outside were very distressed over the whole situation. What sort of thing is this to do to 3 disabled people. As an import side note; Ms. Marty Martin found herself in similar situation with Amtrak-also left alone and abandoned also disabled and a senior citizen, all facts which will not shine bright upon your organization. I am not educated in such matter but it is difficult to imagine that the media would look at such instances as anything other than a serious breach in a chain of proper security protocols and an abusive of disabled people.

After I complained about this when, after another inordinate wait, the red caps finally showed up. Again how was a disabled man the last one to DE-train when he should have been first? When they finally arrived they dragged my luggage on the ground and acted incredibly irritated at our existence.
Again I would be excited to see the security tapes! 

You are hugely mistaken if you think I fear them—I am certain clever lawyers would be able to make effective arguments in certain areas but it seems doubtful that they would be able to effectively neutralize the sum total of them nor the most damaging aspects of them. And any little they would be able to accomplished would be built on a foundation of lies.

Is this really what you want to be doing with your life? Spending time making
up lies against a poor and sick disabled family who only want their wheelchairs fix after Amtrak broke them? 

Is this an admirable goal? 

That due to my lack of an effective disability scooter I have lost at least two jobs and me and my children are living on a hotel vouchers designed for the homeless? To you this, something Amtrak is DIRECTLY responsible for, is fair? 

I ASKED Amtrak what was “--the best way to ship them--” (and so did My wife and my sister-in-law) we followed the guidelines Amtrak laid out for me and went the extra step by removing mirrors and other items and took additional measure above and beyond what you employes had outlined to insure their safe transport.

If you wanted to create and environment to file a claim it seem leaving the mirror in place would have been a perfect opportunity. Why remove them why go thru all the hassles we did?
You sound like a cop who been on his beat to long—everyone got an angle right—every ones a liar? Is that it?

All I can do is FOLLOW Amtrak s guidance in such matters I am NO expert in shipping disability wheelchairs on a train. 

I did as I was told. Period.
 
My disability ID was hanging around my neck they asked to see it—umm OK—I remarked that shouldn’t you be asking to see my ID BEFORE I get on the train NOT after I got off of it? And why do 7 people need to see it? Are they the seven Stooges? At the Very least does that sound like competent system to you? Yeah they weren't doing it to harass me right? 

Is that what you tell yourself? Does it work? Do you believe it?
 
Without going into every detail (far from it) as this was a never ending nightmare Kathy Baker refused my right to file a complaint—the laws under ADA, as I understand it clearly state I am entitled to file a complaint even if it is discovered to have no merit. And to deny me the right to file it is a violation of my rights, again even if that claim has NO MERIT!
 
I understood very clearly that Kathy Baker was giving me a choice ( once more the security tapes will show we weighed all the packages and none exceed required limits—she did though claim I had one too many—so I disagreed but surrendered because I wanted my disabled sick children to get on the train. Don't worry The McDonnell's will testify as to our behavior. And considering their background they will make very powerful witnesses. 
 
What’s my proof that the 6 other parcels weren’t over weight? Ms. Baker let me take them with me. Whats my proof I was unruly the transit police-I engaged them on both occasions and they were kind warm and generous. I don't think you'll get any help their.

Perhaps you should turn this over to your legal department, matter of fact I request you do so if you are not going to be reasonable —I need their name and address if you wish to go the summons and complaint right—and I am not talking small claims court either. As you know the most likely would be a mandatory settlement conference ordered by a federal judge and we would be forced to resolve it their, for a level I am sure would exceed the repairs to both wheelchairs and the refund of our round trip.

Is this the rout you wish to go? Even having to answer the summons and complaint
served to you by federal marshals, because I have no one to severe you and I'll be forced (if I choose to proceed without a lawyer) to file IN FORMA PAUPERIS. My filing fee would be zero, your motions to file with the court would not.

All of this would go well beyond what you would invest now by simply doing the right thing which is all I ever asked for. Many of your employes were rude cruel and abusive and it is hard to believe BOTH of wheelchairs were NOT destroyed out of spite. 

Not negligence but maliciousness. 

Whose going to believe that I tried to file a complaint for being locked on a cold dark abandoned train, my luggage was tossed about and abused, I was repeatedly asked for my id (while it was hanging around my neck--displayed—I went to file a complaint, I was told I had enough time to file a complaint or board the next train that had a 3 hour lay over-I was forced to move my own luggage, we were abused by your conductor all the way to La and LO and Behold BOTH of my wheelchairs are destroyed; one wont work at all and the other only goes in reserve.

Who on God's green Earth is going to believe that—you better start looking for the OJ jury and see if their available—their your one and only hope.
How is this a payday? This is just what's right-make the repairs to the chairs. You know and I can prove that both are six months old. 

Yeah I'd have to get federal subpena to do so and get a very wealthy and affluent business man from San Diego to testify as to what condition the chair was in and how old it was when he donated it to me. He already told me while he would like to come, for business reason he'd have to demonstrate it was under court order—no one likes to go to court we get it.

You're right I am responding to the pressure that I don't want him to hate me or anyone—after all he gave me a 27K (plus) chair and DELIVERED to me from San Diego to Los Angeles at his expense (hundreds of dollars) and now you want me to subpoena him?

You're right I DON'T want to BUT I will.

Yeah and I'd have to subpoena the repair and maintenance records from my other wheelchair provider (let's be honest I am not getting these without court orders-I already tried-my phone company told me the same thing about my relevant text messages we sent re: Amtrak-yep I can only get them with a court order).

Great whose the bad guy here? Me? I don't want a lawsuit-its you.

I'll be a hassle and everyone will be VERY unhappy most people HATE to go to court or even PREPARE anything for court but after all is said and done I'll have it and Amtrak WILL lose more in time and money and reputation than if you just do the right thing, the FAIR thing.

ADA Title II: State and Local Government Activities The transportation provisions of title II cover public transportation services, such as city buses and public rail transit (e.g. subways, commuter rails, Amtrak). Public transportation authorities may not discriminate against people with disabilities in the provision of their services. They must comply with requirements for accessibility in newly purchased vehicles, make good faith efforts to purchase or lease accessible used buses, re-manufacture buses in an accessible manner, and, unless it would result in an undue burden, provide para-transit where they operate fixed-route bus or rail systems. Para-transit is a service where individuals who are unable to use the regular transit system independently (because of a physical or mental impairment) are picked up and dropped off at their destinations. 

You should also understand that the problems run ever deeper as Mr. Brown, Mrs. Martin, Paul, Beth, Shausana both of the McDonells and a few others were witness to much of Amtrak’s antics.
 
How about our ride BACK to LA? What happened there? Did Mrs. Baker have a friend on crew who took revenge on us? Because we were treated like death row inmates on our way to California/ Denied Bathroom access, equal use of chairs as seating as abled bodied passenger i.e. an abled bodied passenger was allowed to use 4 seats while we only allowed to stay in our wheelchairs.
 
The conductor was rude and abusive, again I was far from the ONLY one who thought so, and yes I have stayed in touch with everyone on board. And being locked in a cold dark train, last one off, denied the right to file a complaint and being threatened at being thrown off the train if I did--”you can file a complaint or catch your train but not both” That's pretty clear isn't it? If not not there are many other wildly inappropriate, abusive, racist, statements that were made along are train ride to hell.
 
Then BOTH my 6 month old wheelchairs are smashed, yeah really? They are still being paid off. I had no incentive other then take the best care I could of them. When I spoke to your person in Philly he is mistaken, nice guy but wrong I told him about my previous chair and the problems I had with that one, hence my 2 new ones, only 6 months old, not yet paid off. That wheelchair was a pediatric one that was mistakenly sent to me, an event well documented both by the state of California, the mobility and my instance company.
I asked your personal if there was ANY paperwork for me to fill out re: shipping my wheelchair they told me “NO.” Much like a rental car agency that is the time to document any scratches or damage. Further when I FIRST shipped with you I DID fill out paperwork and the employes DID remark the stellar condition BOTH wheelchairs were in and how they needed to demonstrate EXTRA care due to that fact, THEY noted it not me. It was clear there was nothing to document and that’s why I was provided nothing to sign.

Nice try but you'll get no traction there.

Please tell me this can be resolved with level heads and commons sense repairs refund and a letter of an apology would be fair. 
 
It’s hardly a pay day, who wanted a horrible ride with my disabled family or the destruction of my 2 wheelchairs?

What sense does that make?

Thanks Seb (my complaint)

how about our ride back to la? what happened there? did mrs. baker have a friend on crew who took revenge on us? because we were treated like death row inmates on our way to california/ denied bathroom access, equal use of chairs as seating as abled bodied passenger i.e. an abled bodied passenger was allowed to use 4 seats while we only allowed to stay in our wheelchairs.
 
the conductor was rude and abusive, again i was far from the only one who thought so, and yes i have stayed in touch with everyone on board. and being locked in a cold dark train, last one off, denied the right to file a complaint and being threatened at being thrown off the train if i did--”you can file a complaint or catch your train but not both” that's pretty clear isn't it? if not not there are many other wildly inappropriate, abusive, racist, statements that were made along are train ride to hell.
 
then both my 6 month old wheelchairs are smashed, yeah really? they are still being paid off. i had no incentive other then take the best care i could of them. when i spoke to your person in philly he is mistaken, nice guy but wrong i told him about my previous chair and the problems i had with that one, hence my 2 new ones, only 6 months old, not yet paid off. that wheelchair was a pediatric one that was mistakenly sent to me, an event well documented both by the state of california, the mobility and my instance company.
i asked your personal if there was any paperwork for me to fill out re: shipping my wheelchair they told me “no.” much like a rental car agency that is the time to document any scratches or damage. further when i first shipped with you i did fill out paperwork and the employes did remark the stellar condition both wheelchairs were in and how they needed to demonstrate extra care due to that fact, they noted it not me. it was clear there was nothing to document and that’s why i was provided nothing to sign.

nice try but you'll get no traction there.

please tell me this can be resolved with level heads and commons sense repairs refund and a letter of an apology would be fair. 
 
it’s hardly a pay day, who wanted a horrible ride with my disabled family or the destruction of my 2 wheelchairs?

what sense does that make?

1087,complaintsboard.com,"I do not complain often, but I would be remiss if I didn't write this after the way I have been treated by Amtrak. Two years ago my husband bought me $200 worth of gift certificates to take a trip from OKC to Ft Worth. Months after that, I discovered I could not reimburse these gift certificates because we did not have a train station located in OKC. This is a stupid policy to begin with, why sell certificates to people if you can't use them from where you live? So, we finally reasoned with the company to send us a $200 voucher. We haven't had the money to take a trip since my husband lost his job shortly after that occurred but I have been saving the voucher. I wanted to give it as a gift for my in-laws for Christmas.

Informed that you can keep a xerox copy of the tickets, drop them in the mail and in 10 days you will see the money refunded onto your credit card. If not give us a call back.""

Beware:
Amtrak has conflicting policies on ticket refunds.
NEVER mail back tickets for refunds. 
If you do send them certified mail.

REPS will tell you conflicting times for your refund
anywhere from “ten days or so” to 3-4 months.

Instead of having each person have accurate information
(they don’t like to be bothered with looking up the policy using
their computer, they usually just make up a time in their head
and strive to get you off the phone. From rep to rep, operator to
refunds deparemtn to customer service to getting hung up
let go of expectations. Getting help via telereps is not going to happen.

Forget about “oh I understand”
or the traditional “how can I help you?”
or “I apologize let me see what I can do”
as a question the rep will probalby just pull something
out of his/her hat instead of offering accurate information
“Can you hold on while I check on that?” will only
be offered if you prompt the customer service rep 
(one claim: there are only 40 of us and I’m the only Chris.)

At Amtrak 8 times out of ten (we tested this)
you are treated like a nuissance.

Customer service reps are the
“last chance” to get any info from 
and they refuse to transfer you to a supervisor: 
“We each handle our own calls. Otherwise you need to write to
washington DC.” (Which sounds like a quick solution, no?)

BEWARE: AMTRAK charges you a 10 percent fee to cash in
(a restocking fee obviously, or maybe to bankrole new training
for reps that give misinformation, burn out, or get booted out!)

BEWARE: AMTRAK has an unending
robotronic voice system that eventually
gets you to be put on hold:
(est. 3/4 hour per chance at getting a “real” teleservices person) 

BEWARE: REFUNDS, you may as well keep the tickets and hope you’ll have the guts to take a trip on the train in the next year.

That is unless you have the fortitude to play investigator, enjoy frustration, being treated poorly, and having absolutely no solution to your problems.

Just an FYI: Buy your tickets when you board the train, 
then again you’ll face a stiffer ticket price.
E-tickets need to be mailed to you if you don’t have
an open Amtrak office close by.
Reps will make you feel like you made a mistake
and no one is going to say “sorry.”
THEY KEEP 10 percent of your ticket value
and you’ll wait months to get the refund.

print the ticket I paid for. 
Since all he had was the paper with the bar code, he proceeded to board the train and showed the paper to the conductor. He then told him to get off the train. My son told him the machine was not working and that the ticket was already paid for. He told him to get off the train or buy a ticket for cash, not even at the online price.
It was very important to catch this train, yet no one helped him.
He called me after the train left. I contacted amtrak and they told me
that he would have to purchase a new ticket at nearly double the price in order to board the next train. He did not have that amount in cash on him and holds no credit cards. 
He was then forced to take a late train after I wired the money, and there was no metro connection that late at night, so I am forced to pick him up at the station when he arrives.

when my son arrived at the station he proceeded to scan the reservation conformation . the machine was broken and would not
print the ticket i paid for. 
since all he had was the paper with the bar code, he proceeded to board the train and showed the paper to the conductor. he then told him to get off the train. my son told him the machine was not working and that the ticket was already paid for. he told him to get off the train or buy a ticket for cash, not even at the online price.
it was very important to catch this train, yet no one helped him.
he called me after the train left. i contacted amtrak and they told me
that he would have to purchase a new ticket at nearly double the price in order to board the next train. he did not have that amount in cash on him and holds no credit cards. 
he was then forced to take a late train after i wired the money, and there was no metro connection that late at night, so i am forced to pick him up at the station when he arrives. i have recently had a heart attack and have no business out at 2 am. thanks to amtrak i have no choice. if anyone knows where to report this situation please let me know. i can never trust amtrak online again and would advise others

Contact your credit card company ASAP and contest the charge for the original fare.

We were the first ones there, we sat down and waited, as we waited I had spoke to several Red Caps trying to find out when their train was going to be there considering it was so loud we could barely here the announcer. Everyone that I spoke to said not to worry we will come get your parents when it is time for them to board.

When the time finally came no one came to get them I just kept asking until the redcap told me it was their train. Everyone started loading on the trams people that were not ever in assited waiting were loading on. These trams were for people whom could not walk all the way down on their own. I watched many people get on that were not even waiting they just walked up and got on. When I finally started walking up to the tram to help my parents get on they shewed us back in a line. At that point I was really upset.

1122,complaintsboard.com,"In October of 2007, my wife and I (65 years old) began a two thousand dollar Amtrak trip in a standard roomette. We were soon subjected to stultifying high temperatures and a lack of ventilation in our 6 and-a-half by 3 and-a-half foot compartment. The unsmiling, condescending and insolent conductors professed helplessness in the face of the oppressive conditions, and when I asked one of the conductors what his name was, he immediately covered his identity badge with his hand!

We continued to object to these conditions, and finally the conductor had the train stopped, called in local marshals, and ejected my wife and I from the train in the middle of the night.

We were forced to quickly pack all of our luggage and drag our bags off the train without any assistance. We had our tickets confiscated, and were left standing in the dark around midnight, after being told that we were forever banned from Amtrak trains. However, we were not the only couple who was profoundly distressed by our Amtrak experience. When the conductor overheard me speaking to one of the marshals about this, he immediately returned our tickets to us and offered my wife and I the option of getting back on the train the following day! What was it that I told the Marshall? That approximately 12 hours before, another couple had been kicked off the train with the accompaniment of the police for complaining about the suffocating conditions!

It's one thing that Amtrak charges high prices for the honor of occupying a tiny bedroom in one of their obsolete railcars. It's another thing if in addition, the service personnel are generally rude, insulting and sadistic. The only exception to this would be in the dining car where a gratuity is expected. My wife and I sued Amtrak for this abusive service and our abandonment in an unknown town in the middle of the night. We won with little difficulty.

1124,complaintsboard.com,"Hello to anyone that cares. First of all this was my first ride on the train going to New York (Manhattan), I truly enjoyed the ride going even though it was 18 hours, no problem at all. From the service all the way to the conductor and his train. my husband and I venture out on the 17th of sept. 2008.

Basically what I am writing about is the trip home was pure-d-heck, there was some young men (boys) on the train using profanity from the time they got on in new york about 2:00 pm until after 12 midnight. Me as a woman and I sure others didn't want to hear All that mess, I politely ask the guys will they please tone it down t was elderly and kids on board and they did for a moment, I guess they thought about it and decided to start back. One guy said the *** with this I can say what want, didn't ask the guys to hush or shut up, I simply ask them to tone the language down as M...F..- S...- F... This and so on. Well as it continue, my husband decided to step in and say something to the guy that was working our train 19 to Atlanta, the guy stated that he will handle it, well as you know he didn't. so another passage decided he will say something to the guys and this man was riding in the back so you know they had to be excessively LOUD. This didn't work either so by this time my husband decide to go get someone else which I believe it was the conductor because he had on a different uniform from the other guy and this particular guy came to finally eject them from our car. Where he put them frankly I didn't care. But this was really ridiculous they way the other guy allowed them to carry on for awhile. as I stated you have kids and elderly/woman-men on the train and they shouldn't be allowed to use that kind of language, you really couldn't get any rest even if you tried. because they wanted to be loud and ignorant. My second pet ped was if you have a lap top or any type of musical item their should be a rule of thumb to use ear plugs, no one wants to hear that crap others are listening to this is rude as ***, if you don't have earplugs you can't use the item. My third pet ped is when you attend the dining car the servers should just assume you want to sit with others, I do know that everyone can't have a table along, but you may have something private you want to talk about with whom ever you are dining with, or may be for one instance while we were there you had to white guys sitting at a table and a black woman came in the pretty much refuse to allow her to sit with them, the server told to the guys ""you can't sit here along you have to share this table"" as the woman was sitting down she was apologizing about having to sit with them when it wasn't her fault, the server place her there. Going the same thing happen to us doing breakfast, they just place someone with us without asking if we mind, (surely it was ok) but its the principle of the whole thing.they brought the lady to the table and said sit here, I just looked up for a moment at first because I didn't know they was actually telling her to sit with us (we enjoyed her) like I stated everyone don't want to sit or be with others no matter what. Now the question is whether I will take another trip on amtrak SURE I WILL. ""Just take care of the language and the no earplugs""","hello to anyone that cares. first of all this was my first ride on the train going to new york (manhattan), i truly enjoyed the ride going even though it was 18 hours, no problem at all. from the service all the way to the conductor and his train. my husband and i venture out on the 17th of sept. 2008.

basically what i am writing about is the trip home was pure-d-heck, there was some young men (boys) on the train using profanity from the time they got on in new york about 2:00 pm until after 12 midnight. me as a woman and i sure others didn't want to hear all that mess, i politely ask the guys will they please tone it down t was elderly and kids on board and they did for a moment, i guess they thought about it and decided to start back. one guy said the *** with this i can say what want, didn't ask the guys to hush or shut up, i simply ask them to tone the language down as m...f..- s...- f... this and so on. well as it continue, my husband decided to step in and say something to the guy that was working our train 19 to atlanta, the guy stated that he will handle it, well as you know he didn't. so another passage decided he will say something to the guys and this man was riding in the back so you know they had to be excessively loud. this didn't work either so by this time my husband decide to go get someone else which i believe it was the conductor because he had on a different uniform from the other guy and this particular guy came to finally eject them from our car. where he put them frankly i didn't care. but this was really ridiculous they way the other guy allowed them to carry on for awhile. as i stated you have kids and elderly/woman-men on the train and they shouldn't be allowed to use that kind of language, you really couldn't get any rest even if you tried. because they wanted to be loud and ignorant. my second pet ped was if you have a lap top or any type of musical item their should be a rule of thumb to use ear plugs, no one wants to hear that crap others are listening to this is rude as ***, if you don't have earplugs you can't use the item. my third pet ped is when you attend the dining car the servers should just assume you want to sit with others, i do know that everyone can't have a table along, but you may have something private you want to talk about with whom ever you are dining with, or may be for one instance while we were there you had to white guys sitting at a table and a black woman came in the pretty much refuse to allow her to sit with them, the server told to the guys ""you can't sit here along you have to share this table"" as the woman was sitting down she was apologizing about having to sit with them when it wasn't her fault, the server place her there. going the same thing happen to us doing breakfast, they just place someone with us without asking if we mind, (surely it was ok) but its the principle of the whole thing.they brought the lady to the table and said sit here, i just looked up for a moment at first because i didn't know they was actually telling her to sit with us (we enjoyed her) like i stated everyone don't want to sit or be with others no matter what. now the question is whether i will take another trip on amtrak sure i will.

The website was designed so that you can't cancel the ticket. You have to call a customer service rep. The rep will tell you they will process the refund but neglect to offer to send you an e-mail confirming that you cancelled the ticket.

Ask for the refund confirmation sent to your e-mail. Amtrak places a hold on the funds with your bank or credit card and does not complete the transaction for several days. If you cancel during this time, they will take the money after your cancellation and put it in a general fund. The money sits there for up to 120 days before it's returned.

The way to get around this, is just plain don't book a ticket on Amtrak. Just in case anything happens, you'll be frustrated and angry that they won't process your refund. I am suing them in my local small claims court, and if you want to sue them too, send me an e-mail. I will have the name and address of their attorney so you can serve them the papers.

1135,complaintsboard.com,"I've read a LOT of bleeding-heart complaints about Amtrak service, most of which could have been avoided. Here's my Top Ten List for Amtrak travelers: 1) Don't board the train with a chip on your shoulder. It is YOUR attitude that dictates how you are treated by the Amtrak staff and fellow passengers. Boarding the train with an attitude of, ""Hello, Amtrak. What can I to make your job easier today?"" goes a LONG way toward making your travel experience more enjoyable for everyone. 2) The train is often off-schedule, and almost all of the time it is due to circumstances beyond Amtrak's control. Yes, there are occasional mechanical ""opportunities, "" but you have those with your own home, car, computer, workplace, etc. Many of the time delays are the result of infrastructure, maintenance, and rail use conflicts. There are occasional personal passenger issues (i.e., medical, safety, etc.) that can cause major delays. Sometimes delays are caused by hostile passengers that require unscheduled stops (sometimes in the middle of nowhere) so local, state, and federal law enforcement can assist Amtrak in adjusting their personal travel schedule. Occasionally someone felt it necessary to attempt to (unsuccessfully) beat a train to a crossing, bringing ALL rail traffic to a grinding halt until the mess can be cleaned up and the tracks repaired. Amtrak cannot control washed out bridges, floods, extreme weather, etc. Getting hostile with the dining car staff because you're behind schedule will NOT make the train move faster. There's a dude up in the engine that has his hand on the throttle lever, and he is in radio contact with a dispatcher who is facilitating all of the rail traffic in the area. It is not his responsibility --- nor does he have time --- to inform you of why he is doing what he is doing. 3) Almost all Amtrak employees are human beings. They react to you the way most humans react to you. If you act like you think you are royalty, they may not accommodate your self-elevated status quickly enough to satisfy you. If you act like you perceive them as your personal lowly servants, they may not immediately assume that lowly state in an appropriately humble way to satisfy you. Do not expect them to genuflect in your presence, or kiss any part of your anatomy in adoration, awe, or reverence. 4) Remember that you are sharing space on a public conveyance with others, many of whom think that THEY are God's gift to the human race. The Amtrak employees (as well as your fellow passengers) are reacting to them (and you) in predictable ways. You may not be fully aware of all of the situations your Amtrak employees are dealing with at any given point in time. Let them do their job without creating yet another issue for them to deal with. 5) Not all Amtrak staff members are fully aware of all of the factors influencing your progression down the tracks at any given point in time. It is not their responsibility to interrupt their duties to become fully aware of why your train is traveling at the speed it is (or is stopped ""in the middle of nowhere"") just to satisfy your curiosity. Relax. Chances are you and the train will probably arrive at about the same time. 6) Use the seat(s) reserved for you --- and ONLY the seat(s) reserved for you --- unless you make specific adjustments with the Conductor. Be considerate of your fellow travelers and not slop your junk (and audio) over into adjacent seats and public spaces. Just because that seat next to you is empty right now, there is no guarantee that it will remain unoccupied past the next station. The Conductor may or may not know if that seat is sold further down the line. 7) It is NOT the responsibility of any Amtrak employee to make sure you detrain at the proper location. Amtrak can only do so much to protect you from your own stupidity, inattention, inadequate planning, and ignorance. 8) Be tolerant of your fellow passengers as well as the Amtrak staff. You do NOT know what internal and external issues and distractions have been impacting their lives for the past 24 hours. 9) If you are the 25th person to tell an Amtrak employee about what you perceive as a problem --- especially if it is something obvious and/or something he/she is powerless to correct --- you may not get the passionately sensitive, genuinely sympathetic response you think you deserve. 10) Remember that Amtrak's sole purpose for existence is to get you from point ""A"" to point ""B"" as quickly and safely as possible. The emphasis is on ""safely."" They probably did not know all of the parameters and circumstances of your specific trip when they published the schedule. Deal with it. Stuff happens. Train delays probably will not cause the world to come to an end. When you perceive an earth-shattering disruption in your travel plans, ask yourself, ""Will any of this really matter 5 years from now?""","i've read a lot of bleeding-heart complaints about amtrak service, most of which could have been avoided. here's my top ten list for amtrak travelers: 1) don't board the train with a chip on your shoulder. it is your attitude that dictates how you are treated by the amtrak staff and fellow passengers. boarding the train with an attitude of, ""hello, amtrak. what can i to make your job easier today?"" goes a long way toward making your travel experience more enjoyable for everyone. 2) the train is often off-schedule, and almost all of the time it is due to circumstances beyond amtrak's control. yes, there are occasional mechanical ""opportunities, "" but you have those with your own home, car, computer, workplace, etc. many of the time delays are the result of infrastructure, maintenance, and rail use conflicts. there are occasional personal passenger issues (i.e., medical, safety, etc.) that can cause major delays. sometimes delays are caused by hostile passengers that require unscheduled stops (sometimes in the middle of nowhere) so local, state, and federal law enforcement can assist amtrak in adjusting their personal travel schedule. occasionally someone felt it necessary to attempt to (unsuccessfully) beat a train to a crossing, bringing all rail traffic to a grinding halt until the mess can be cleaned up and the tracks repaired. amtrak cannot control washed out bridges, floods, extreme weather, etc. getting hostile with the dining car staff because you're behind schedule will not make the train move faster. there's a dude up in the engine that has his hand on the throttle lever, and he is in radio contact with a dispatcher who is facilitating all of the rail traffic in the area. it is not his responsibility --- nor does he have time --- to inform you of why he is doing what he is doing. 3) almost all amtrak employees are human beings. they react to you the way most humans react to you. if you act like you think you are royalty, they may not accommodate your self-elevated status quickly enough to satisfy you. if you act like you perceive them as your personal lowly servants, they may not immediately assume that lowly state in an appropriately humble way to satisfy you. do not expect them to genuflect in your presence, or kiss any part of your anatomy in adoration, awe, or reverence. 4) remember that you are sharing space on a public conveyance with others, many of whom think that they are god's gift to the human race. the amtrak employees (as well as your fellow passengers) are reacting to them (and you) in predictable ways. you may not be fully aware of all of the situations your amtrak employees are dealing with at any given point in time. let them do their job without creating yet another issue for them to deal with. 5) not all amtrak staff members are fully aware of all of the factors influencing your progression down the tracks at any given point in time. it is not their responsibility to interrupt their duties to become fully aware of why your train is traveling at the speed it is (or is stopped ""in the middle of nowhere"") just to satisfy your curiosity. relax. chances are you and the train will probably arrive at about the same time. 6) use the seat(s) reserved for you --- and only the seat(s) reserved for you --- unless you make specific adjustments with the conductor. be considerate of your fellow travelers and not slop your junk (and audio) over into adjacent seats and public spaces. just because that seat next to you is empty right now, there is no guarantee that it will remain unoccupied past the next station. the conductor may or may not know if that seat is sold further down the line. 7) it is not the responsibility of any amtrak employee to make sure you detrain at the proper location. amtrak can only do so much to protect you from your own stupidity, inattention, inadequate planning, and ignorance. 8) be tolerant of your fellow passengers as well as the amtrak staff. you do not know what internal and external issues and distractions have been impacting their lives for the past 24 hours. 9) if you are the 25th person to tell an amtrak employee about what you perceive as a problem --- especially if it is something obvious and/or something he/she is powerless to correct --- you may not get the passionately sensitive, genuinely sympathetic response you think you deserve. 10) remember that amtrak's sole purpose for existence is to get you from point ""a"" to point ""b"" as quickly and safely as possible. the emphasis is on ""safely."" they probably did not know all of the parameters and circumstances of your specific trip when they published the schedule. deal with it. stuff happens. train delays probably will not cause the world to come to an end. when you perceive an earth-shattering disruption in your travel plans, ask yourself, ""will any of this really matter 5 years from now?""","[""i've"", 'read', 'lot', 'bleeding-heart', 'complaints', 'amtrak', 'service,', 'could', 'avoided.',

Dear Sirs:

My dearest sister, Cheryl Whitmire, decided to give me a surprise treat and purchased a train trip for her to come from Sacramento, CA down to Van Nuys, CA to pick me up and then both of us went on Amtrak to visit my elderly mother and father (my sister paid for the entire Amtrak ticket for both of us). Then, she came all the way back with me just to keep me company from Stockton, CA to Van Nuys, CA; then she went back to Sacramento. The date was April 10th (Thursday) from Sacramento, CA down to Van Nuys, CA Amtrak station in the name of Cheryl Whitmire. 

On our return trip from Oakland to Van Nuys CA we got on the Stockton Amtrak, Sunday April 20th at 9:14 A.M. going into Van Nuys with somebody picking us up that evening late. The train broke down just three minutes after we departed Stockton and they kept trying to start up the engine to no avail. We sat on the side tracks for two hours waiting for Amtrak to send another train to pick us up after the breakdown and non-start.

I became extremely upset! My entire day was totally ruined because my sister and I were not able to meet our friends that were waiting at the Van Nuys, CA Amtrak station that night on time as planned.

I know that we have a refund coming because a frequent Amtrak traveler wrote the enclosed letter while we were sitting there wondering what to do with ourselves for two hours. I was told by this gentleman that Amtrak would give me a credit number and send a total refund so that my sister’s expense would be totally refunded to her credit card. 

Please let me know as soon as possible when you will be sending the entire amount of refund. Please call me at #[protected] Joanna Fay Polak, or email mjpolak@earthlink.net; or write a letter to Joanna Fay Polak, 3550 Poppy Drive, Calabasas, CA [protected]. I would like to use Amtrak again on September 30th, 2008.
