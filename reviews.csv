13,yelp.com,"Amtrak has always been a reliable transportation for me to get to NYC from Boston. Its clean, has comfortable coach seats and the customer service is awesome. I lost my wallet during a trip from NY to BOS, I ran to the ticketing booth to see if they could help me contact the conductor. Danielle from the ticketing booth was able to contact the conductor, Dan, and they were able to help me find my wallet! They were incredibly nice and understanding. 10/10 would always recommend taking the Amtrak from BOS to NYC."
14,yelp.com,"Not a bad way to head to New York or Philadelphia if the price is right and if everything runs on time - both of which are big ifs. The Acela trains are generally the fastest option between Boston and New York since you don't have to wade thru traffic on both ends in getting to the airport. They're also reasonably comfortable inside, with seats that offer enough width and leg room so that you can get things done on your laptop or snooze cozily. They can be just as - if not more - expensive than flying, but you can get good deals if you can buy more than 14 days beforehand. They're not truly ""high-speed"" in a European sense, though, and the ""business class"" cabin is similar to what would be 2nd-class in Europe. The Northeast Regional trains are slower, not just because they might stop at more stations, but also because they can be deprioritized behind Acela and freight trains - so delays can cascade dramatically. Coach-class seats have better legroom than planes but are still anything but glamorous, especially if everyone around you is yakking on their phones. All this having been said, they're usually cheaper than Acela trains. Again, if everything runs on time and you can get a reasonably priced fare, Acela is definitely the way to go to New York or Philly. It still takes too long to get to DC, though, so flying is much faster and usually cheaper."
15,yelp.com,"Rotting on stopped Amtrak California Zephyr. No idea when trip will resume. Conductor chimes in occasionally with jokes, apparently thinks it's funny. Buyer beware...this is third world stuff."

17,yelp.com,"Amtrak is one of my favorite ways to travel. Either between Boston and Providence or to NYC. Why drive when you can sit and enjoy the ride? No traffic to deal with, cold beverages and snacks at your leisure, restrooms etc. To me, Amtrak travel is a no brainer. I suggest booking your tickets as soon as you can because the price is often wayyyy cheaper when there is plenty of time before your trip. Tickets can sometimes double if not triple in price if you wait for the last minute."
18,yelp.com,"Overall, the Acela experience to and from PHL to BOS was very pleasant.  On the way up, the experience was nearly perfect with helpful staff. I opted for the QUIET car, which, for the most part, was observed.  The wifi was strong and there was  plug if you needed to power up any electric gear.  The seat was comfy. It was really cold in there with the AC blasting, but glad I had a jacket to keep me warm.On the way back, it was just slightly less pleasant, not all of Amtrak's fault.  I hadn't had a chance to eat, so after settling in to my seat and waiting a while, I headed up to the club car to get some snacks. The guy working there was really rude, almost yelling, ""I'm not open yet!""  Well, the next sentence should have been, ""Come back in XXXXX AMOUNT OF TIME!""  Instead, he made a shooing motion to go away.  When I tried to ask when I should come back, he literally turned his back on me and walked away.  OKAY.Otherwise, the experience was quite nice."
19,yelp.com,"Recently the NE regional has been abysmal with delays in excess of 2 hours even under optimal weather conditions. Given the price point (often hundreds of dollars between Boston and New York), consider driving or walking"
20,yelp.com,"Yo, can any IT person fix the wifi on these trains in coach in NEC? Us peasants need the free internet.  I think I took the Acela once from Boston to NYC Penn station and had no problems. Seats are comfortable and the train is fairly on time. Too bad we don't have high speed bullet trains like Japan. Definitely beats taking a flight since there's no TSA check-in, but you also have the drawback of no seats in south station to really wait for the train. There's pigeons flying everywhere inside the station ready to snatch your mcnuggets out of your grubby hands. Nothing fancy on the cafe train. Maybe the business class got steaks and lobster but then it'd be like snowpiercer the movie."
21,yelp.com,"My first experience with Amrak and it was fine.  I am a fan of public transportation in big cities, having taken subways and buses.  It was a little confusing knowing which train and which track, so we had to ask, but it got us where we needed to be.  We had round-trip spots to and from Boston and New London, CT.The guys who scanned our tickets after we were seated were very personable and helpful with questions."
22,yelp.com,"after a decade in Europe, this touted 150mph rail line for the NE corridor, is a joke. I don't think it travelled more than 6omph.  The ticket price I paid was $800 for first class. WOW. I could purchase a first class air line ticket for that price. the stations are dark and dirty, noisy, announcements are screamed so loudly to be not understandable. On the train there was a ticker that had a warning as if it was in a war zone. Maybe they could announce the stations instead, as the stations are not signed. why was this Acela stoping so frequently? slowed to a crawl through stations. the AC made the ride seem as if one was in a ice box. Interior not modern at all with big overstuffed chairs. this was not much faster than the regular train, so why all the hype?"
23,yelp.com,"So I haven't been on an Amtrack in a very long time. I was in Boston and needed to get to Philadelphia and my partners said ""don't go back to the airport take Amtrack Acela"" and since they were the locals I said okay. So the price was about the same as doing a AA flight out of Logan to Philly and the car was reasonable but the ride is just too long.  It was a 9:10am that arrived in Philly at 2:05pm.  This is just long....now if I was in NYC and needed to go to Philly for sure i would do it.This is a slow train because it just stops alot and at least there is Wifi that is fine for email but you cannot stream. Not in a hurry go for it.  NYC to Phily for sure, but Boston to NYC/Philly/WA it is just too long."

45,yelp.com,"It had been a couple of years since I last took an Amtrak train ride, and it seemed like the best option for me at the time, as I was making last minute travel plans while in Boston. I could not WAIT to leave my nightmare of a hotel so I just jumped online and found the next trip out of the city, purchased my ticket online, called a cab, and disappeared into the ether mid-day, even though I had already paid for my room for the night.I ended up booking a single traveler, privacy room from Boston to Washington, DC, and it was so comfy that I am secretly planning my next trip via Amtrak as I type this. I can't wait to get on the road again!Especially now, during the pandemic, it's really nice to not have anyone sitting next to you, getting up and down and generally being a distraction. It just so happened that I had my super comfy sleeping bag with me in my hiker's backpack, so I crawled right into it and enjoyed the luxury of the Amtrak trip. It's much, MUCH simpler than schlepping through the airport and through TSA, so I would highly suggest to anyone traveling during these uncertain times of Covid-19, to seriously consider booking your trip on the lovely Amtrak. YAY!!"
46,yelp.com,"I wish I could write a good review on Amtrak but the attitude of the employees and subarctic weather in the cars won't allow. I'm wasting my time here and will continue to be amazed and astounded by these classy people for many years to come. Way to go Amtrak, the pride shows in your work."

48,yelp.com,"++ Amtrak in Boston's South Station is a central location, accessible by bus, MBTA, and of course, Amtrak. You can get to anywhere you need to on the northeast US coast, and also in the city of Boston via South Station. + Amtrak provides a mobile app for ticket scanning, - decently clean seats (could be cleaner), ++ a café car, and friendly train conductors.  ++ If you've read this review up to now, your reward is now a pro cost-saving tip for anyone trying to move items cross country... AMTRAK FREIGHT SHIPPING. I shipped 306 lb of items from Boston across the country. Pricing in early 2020 is as follows: the first 1-50 lb is 85$; 51-100 lb is $95 and then additively 0.95/lb for anything 100lb+. You can't ship electronics or glass items, and no box can be over 50 lbs (they do weigh it before you pay). Payment is based on the total weight of the boxes you plan on shipping. The office hours are great, 8 AM - 7:30 PM on 7 days/week.++ Amtrak has a phone line that you can use to inquire about this service. This phone line is the only way you can get information about this service - minimal information is found on the web. The phone line folks told me my items would be palletized prior to loading onto a train. Palletization means that all your boxes get wrapped together and attached to a wooden slat and moved via forklift all at once. Decent.- The individual at South Station's Amtrak Freight Shipping office was a new kind of rude that I had not yet encountered. Keep in mind there was nobody else in line or waiting for this service. It was early morning, pretty quiet.  He informed us that my items would not be palletized, and gruffly informed to adjust the weights on our boxes as they were about 3 lb over in 1 box. The concern with not palletizing boxes in my opinion is that there is a higher chance one might separate from the rest, and might get damaged during the move. On top of that was the fact that this was simply the opposite of what we had been told about the Amtrak Freight Shipping service via phone line. Kinda bummed that Kevin was the last Bostonian I encountered before I left this storied city. Hope he's doing well tho. - There is no tracking on your items that are shipped, everything is very manual and does not seem to be very electronic - I guess this is why costs are low? Make sure you buy some insurance on your items, although nobody ever really wants to be dragged into the tedious process of getting insurance payout on damaged or lost items. Insurance is $1 per $100. ++ I dropped my stuff off late January and it arrived across country on early February in about 5 days! I had been told that a cross country move would take 4 days but up to 8-9 days due to winter and trains having to make a detour due to weather. The destination station of your items will give you a call when your items arrive. If you don't pick it up after 48 hrs of arrival to the destination, they charge $5/box/day."
49,yelp.com,"Unless you have been living under a rock for the past seven years, I am sure you have figured out my love for trains. As a frequent rider of Amtrak, I had never gotten to ride the Northeast Corridor from wire to wire (Boston to Washington, DC) until just this very moment. Riding the train between both of these cities is an exhausting, yet an exhilarating adventure that I encourage everybody to do, at least once, no matter what direction. But if you do it, do it riding the Acela. It is a much faster, more manageable trip than if you ride the Northeast Regional, which is great if you plan on starting or ending your trip in New York. Anything longer might wear you down. But I went wire to wire, city to city, departing at 11:55 am and arriving into the District just before 7 pm. There is something romantic about the train that you just cannot get from flying. The beautiful Connecticut coastlines pass you by as blue as the sky, the fall foliage in the back drop just a flicker in your eye as you zoom through Rhode Island at 150 mph, crossing the iconic Hell Gate Bridge as you make a dramatic entrance into New York City, all make for an unforgettable experience. That is not including flying through New Jersey through long stretches at 135 mph in addition to the cityscapes of Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore. Crossing the Susquehanna river always brings a tear to my eye because of how gorgeous and wide it is, even if you are only riding at 90 mph, because whether it is a clear day, rainy day, or a night only illuminated by the full moon, it is always special to make that crossing, like the great explorers crossing the seas into the great unknown, you too are crossing, but for a much smaller purpose. As you can see, this is why trains are important. They do more than just get you there, they get you there in style. Not in speed or glitz and glamour, but in a romantic, 19th century emotion that makes you not want to get off, but rather get back on and make another journey."

53,yelp.com,"This is a wonderful building and didn't disappoint my expectations of a train station. It is accessible from the street and the underground (we took the T from Quincy and it was easy to find). It was busy and organized. Huge ceilings and large windows let a lot of natural light in. The bathrooms were packed but there was a worker there cleaning up. There were plenty of places to get something to eat.Since my friends and I had a sleeper car, we were able to sit in the Amtrak's Acela lounge with complimentary drinks and snacks. (Tip, if you are unable to navigate the stairs, let the doorman know, there is a locked elevator around the corner they will give you access to.) They also let us know when it was time to board. I'm glad, because you couldn't hear the announcements well inside the lounge."
54,yelp.com,"Amtrak is the old reliable way to travel in Northeast corridor.   It shines when the airports are in a mess.  I waited 7 hours in Logan after my early morning flight got returned back to the gate after 1 hour on the tarmac.   Then, I endured 2 cancelled flights and no way to get back until late night due to weather.  I called Amtrak and they were running on-time and had room on the Acela in the late afternoon!    I walked out of Logan and took the Silverline to South Station - about a 15 mins ride and I was on my way home!It was a comfortable ride and I got back to NYC within 4 hours...   thanks Amtrak!"
55,yelp.com,"Had to take the Amtrak from Boston to New York after a horrible experience with Greyhound. While traveling, I was reminded why the train is the best mode of transportation between the two cities. The Northeast Corridor never has any issues, clean bathroom and decent food on board. The status of the train is clearly communicated though the app and the conductors are friendly and knowledgeable about their route. Seats are comfortable enough for sleeping and the drop down trays and outlets make it easy to work. The Amtrak internet is a little spotty, but it's free.Always try to book as early as possible to get the best price (sometimes tickets from Boston to NYC are as low as $100 round trip)"

78,yelp.com,"I looked forward to a relaxing day aboard a train from Boston's Back Bay station to Albany, New York and then a sleeping car to Cleveland, Ohio after a long but productive week visiting clients. I was not disappointed.I booked the Amtrak tickets online. Their website is kind of clunky and the information about the amenities aboard the trains limited. An upgrade is in order. A handful of short videos that shows riders what to expect would go a long, long way to improving the experience.Train 449 from Boston to Albany was superb. A few passengers continuing via sleeper car were pulled aside and seated in what seemed to be a business class car near the front of the train. Maybe that was included in the price of the ticket but, if so, that wasn't obvious to me when I purchased the ticket and it wasn't indicated on the printout of the ticket.Seating was incredibly comfortable. Tons of leg room -- far more than you get when flying first class -- and plugs and free wifi throughout the train. Being able to stand, walk around, and visit with friends make for a pleasurable, stress free experience. The conductors were friendly and clearly had a passion for rail.Upon arrival in Albany we moved into the nice, clean station for maybe 30 minutes while the train was reconfigured. I heard that the train from Boston is literally merged with the train from New York and the combined train then continues west to Chicago with stops in a handful of cities including my destination of Cleveland.The sleeper car was great as was the sleeper car attendant, Alfred. He was friendly, eager to please, and seemed to really enjoy making the travel experience a pleasure for the riders. The cabins was roughly four feet wide, eight feet long, and 10 feet high. There were two seats, a sink, and a toilet. The seats converted into a single bed and a second single bed lowered from the ceiling with the end result being like a bunk bed. Alfred did a nice job of showing me the various amenities and talking through what I could expect after I boarded and then converted my seats into the bed when I was ready.Dinner in the dining car was included. There were roughly 10 tables with each setup for four passengers. No reservations were necessary. You just showed up, were seated, ordered, and your cooked-to-order meal then served. I was traveling alone and so could have been seated with others if there wasn't room but I ended up alone at the table. That was fine with me as I was in the midst of watching a movie on my laptop. There were some other tables were strangers shared a table and every single one of them seemed to enjoy the experience. Lots of laughter and friendships made.I wouldn't hesitate to repeat the experience. It was fun, relaxing, and a great experience."
79,yelp.com,"Utter trash, 2 guaranteed trips, 2 refunds. Do not guarantee travelling when not having the ability to do so. Had to wait in the south Boston station for hours during the 1st day then next day, just to go get a hotel room since by no choice getting stranded. Fuck Amtrak and their CEO, executives with power to make major decisions. I do not blame the employees but their higher ups."
80,yelp.com,"$300 + to travel from Stamford to Rte 128 on a Sunday morning?  Assigned seating is a joke. When I got to my seat, someone was sitting in it. Conductor told me to sit wherever I wanted. . Where should I sit in the age of Covid? i told him the rules are Amtrak's not mine. They assign the seats. He told me there's something wrong with the app. Sorry. Not my fault. Your job to fix it.  Come on! Trains are great. Being a conductor is a cool job. Try doing it."
81,yelp.com,"After venturing through the subterranean lair that is New York's Penn Station, the sight of a well lit and spacious train station was great to say the least!  The ride from New York to Boston was uneventful and I was pleased that I was able to grab a spot in the 'Quiet Car'.  The scenery along the way was just awesome and if you are not pressed for time, I highly recommend hoping aboard the Northeast Regional for the 4 hour journey to Bahstun.  It is cheap, fun and relaxing."
82,yelp.com,"I was boarding my train from PVD to BOS, Acela Express number 2164, Dec. 20th. 2019. During my boarding at PVD station I received racist profiling and profiling based on race by a black male first class conductor. I was trying to board the train, and held my iPhone on my hand showing the ticket in Apple Wallet. I showed the ticket to his face and showed my intention for boarding the first class train. However, despite the ticket in his face, he first asked me ""first class?"" and even after I pushed the ticket right in front of his face, he insisted ""are you first class on Acela 2164?"" I answered yes and let myself in. After I was seated, I heard him asking the other white male conductor to double check my ticket. When I showed my ticket in front of his face for a solid 5+ seconds. If he couldn't read then I don't think he should qualify for this job as a FIRST CLASS conductor. He should be considered a safety hazard due to his inability to respect guests, refrain from racism/profiling, and read train tickets. Afterwards the actual ticket inspector came alone and respectfully examined my tickets, which is the 3rd time I showed my tickets to board this damn train.It would be one thing if I was dressed like a bum and trying to board the train, but even in such a case after I showed him my ticket I should be allowed to board without triple checking my tickets. And I was wearing a $300 custom made leather shoes, $700 Canada Goose jacket, $300 Bose headphone, $400 Tumi bag, and $1000 Rimowa carry-on case. I was dressed very respectful, and he still doubted that I paid for my seat on this train. Which lead me to my conclusion that it could only be a racist act since I am asian and looked young. I am not aware of any regulations stating 20ish people are forbidden from riding first class on Amtrak. I am a Platinum Medallion with Delta airlines, and I fly 50+ times and spends 15k+ on flights each year. No once any airline employee doubted my right to priority boarding or seating in first class after I show them my ticket/membership card. This experience with Amtrak has convinced me that I should avoid Amtrak whenever possible and never pay for a first class ticket again. Why would I spend $100 on a half hour journey for this level of service again?"
83,yelp.com,"This is a review for the Northeast Regional train from Boston South to DC (Not Acela). I went round trip.Train there left on time, and arrive an hour late. This was apparently due to engine trouble. I did not notice anything wrong. But, stuff does happen...Train on the way back was delayed... by 10 minutes, and arrived 10 minutes early. The train itself is very clean, and, even though I went Coach, the seats were comfortable, and had a lot of legroom. I say this even though I am not a small guy by any means. While business class does not have this, I was in the quiet car. This is great!! Though I never flew, I heard lots of horror stories in relation to the noise. Here, I could listen to my music through cheap,m non-noise-canceling headphones, stare out the window, and not be disturbed. Food is alright, good enough to get you through a long train ride, (they do take credit cards) If you want your own food... pack a lunch!Bathrooms are pretty clean, especially considering this is a train, and everything that does in stays there (a little out of sight). They can be a little odor, but nothing too heavy, neither from fragrance in the blue water, neither from what people put inside it...The only thing that was a little weird was that power kept going out somewhere around CT. However, doors, WiFi, some lights, and of course brakes, still worked. Aside from the lights, outlets, and AC turning off, you would not notice. Unlike in subways, there isn't any rapid deceleration. Also, trying to sleep in a coach class seat proved to be a challenge for me. But there were a lot of people in that train who slept just fine. (this was the trian headed back, one that left at 10 at night for Boston."
84,yelp.com,I love the train.. quick and easy. It is the surge pricing that Amtrak should be ashamed of. Why is one way on a holiday weekend $162.00. ONE WAY!!!! The prices are ridiculous it ranges anywhere from 75.00 to 215.00. One way.  I have taken that train for years... At one time it was $84.00 round trip. I get that times change but a flight should not be less expensive than a train ride. Amtrak should be regulated somehow. It won't happen but should.
85,yelp.com,"Traveling to Boston, I need to arrive at the South Station to be within walking distance for an appointment at The Harvard Club (two blocks away). The Amtrak website was down, I called the toll free number. Purchased my ticket, not problem. The ticket says ""New York Penn Station to BOS (South Station).""No, there is a problem! The train arrives in Boston at the BACK BAY STATION!?! Instead of a two block walk to my meeting, IT'S TWO MILES.Standing in a snow flurry at 16 degrees was not my plan. I finally caught a cab and made it to my meeting in about 15 minutes.The train was great, just not the toll free service. Cost me $12 for the cab ride."
86,yelp.com,"I need to use a walker for distances. An Amtrak employee in Boston saw me approaching the train and instantly offered to help me board the train, found me a ""disability"" seat and made sure I was comfortable. When my train left New York, a conductor asked if I needed any assistance, either right then or when I reached my destination.  As a result, he carried my bag and walker off the train when I got off and offered to walk me to the elevator, which was quite a distance. All the Amtrak people were very pleasant and accommodating. This wasn't my first Amtrak trip and I won't hesitate to use it again when necessary. It's great to know that my disability won't stop me from travelling!"
87,yelp.com,"The ACELA is the best way to get from Boston to NYC. It's 4 hrs door to door and way more reliable than flying. Sure the flight is only an hour but, the cab to and out of the airports, the extra time to go thru security, and the potential for weather delays in winter, make flying a much more stressful and generally slower option.IMPORTANT: Ride the Acela not the regular train. The Acela is a fast Business/First only express train. Splurge on first class if you can, they feed you a better meal than you get on the plane. The regular train service is uncomfortable and slow. The Amtrak staff is a mixed bag. You sometimes get great staff and sometimes some not so great Amtrak life timers.A word of advice If this is your first time, don't take the late night train into NY Penn Station, the NYP station turns into a hotel for the homeless at night and feels more unpredictable and scary than the rebel headquarters in the Terminator movies. This is not a good first impression of NYC to carry with you."

110,yelp.com,"Like most yelpers, I glide down the Amtrak tracks in an Acela train at a top speed of 150 mph on route to NYC. The journey starts off at South Station after having booked a reservation online (ranging from $100-$150 for business class). Head to a machine to print out your ticket, sign the top left and you're off. Takes less than five minutes. That is if you wrote down your confirmation number and didn't rely on technology to provide it when you swipe your card like the ones in Penn Station. Can you tell I've made this mistake before?Anyhow, hop onto a clean train (skip the first car unless you want to get snapped at for answering your phone, silent area), stake out a good seat and get settled. Feel free to kick up your legs, bust out your laptop or charge your phone cuz they've got an outlet per person. And unless you're a serious germaphobe, put away the Purell; the restrooms are clean. Gasp! For part of Connecticut the tracks hug the ocean. On the left side of the train on the way and the right side on the way back, you'll see gorgeous landscapes whizzing by. Pulling into the station at the predicted hour the dozen times I've rode the rails, and with the subway a few steps in reach there's really no reason to fly. Unless of course you enjoy waiting in those security lines."
111,yelp.com,"In general, I will always opt to take the Amtrak over buses or planes to travel in the Northeast, so if it weren't for the incident I had below, this would be a 4/5. I haven't had issues with delays though sometimes the bathrooms reek of urine by the time the train hits New York. I recently forgot a baggage on train when it got to South Station, and luckily the bag was found and returned to me. I was really happy about that, but also dismayed to find the bag completely rifled through, with several items - gifts I got from the holiday, chargers, leather gloves, a bra (?!) - missing. Because I got off at the terminal stop there's almost no chance that another passenger did this, and not a member of their staff over the 2 days it took them to tell me the bag was at South Station. So, thanks but seriously, give your staff some ethics training."

A few weeks later I was told to wait and that there were conductors and staff on the train to help me. There was NO ONE on the train to help. I left my bag in the area for those with disabilities. The employee who told me there were staff on the train to help was sitting down and leaning back with legs spread wide open while saying this to me.

114,yelp.com,"I no longer travel on air in the Northeast Corridor.  Between the harassment gauntlet at TSA checkpoints, the sheer lack of courtesy and performance of US Air, the horrible delays in air transportation, having to pay for luggage, carry-ons, and almost breathing in airlines nowadays, rude and even misanthropic flight attendants, and having slave-ship seat space on crowded and smelly airplanes, Amtrak is a welcome change in today's otherwise exasperating transportation experience.  Both in Acela as well as the Amtrak Regional trains, the passenger space and comfort is at least double than that of passenger airplanes.  You have room to read and relax.  Stop by the snack car and get some munchies.  And relax and enjoy the view.  As a matter of fact, with the time in transportation to far away terminals, having to get in early for security gauntlet delays, sitting on the gate for an hour on FAA delays, and then schlepping home from another distant airport, Amtrak is a breeze.  Hands down.  The Acela I'm riding now, in addition, offers complimentary WiFi (US Air, stick it) and even awesome clam chowder by Legal Sea Foods.  What else can you ask for?"
115,yelp.com,"I am officially spoiled.  I can't imagine taking a bus to NY ever again after this truly luxurious experience.  I mean, the ticket prices are no joke, but once you're on the train you realize what that money buys you: a comfy seat that reclines, a footrest, a fold-down table, a traffic-free trip to your destination, a snack car at your disposal if you get hungry in the middle of the ride, a restroom, and my personal favorite... drum roll... electrical outlets conveniently located next to every seat!!  They don't even offer those on planes (except Virgin Atlantic I've heard, but it's defniitely uncommon)!  I plugged in my iPod while I watched a movie, as to not drain the battery, and also charged my cell phone.  How convenient!  Traffic is a non-issue, as is parking, the Amtrak takes you where you need to go and gets you there in relative style.  I took the Acela Express so I can't comment on the older trains, but it was a pretty great start and end to my weekend in NYC.  Like I said I've been spoiled, and unfortunately my wallet may see the unfortunate effects of this newest discovery, but so be it.  I highly recommend this method of travel!  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I still think it costs more than plane tickets to LA (ie Southwest has pretty cheap fares!), but it's a great option to have."
116,yelp.com,"I like it. I like it a lot. I definitely prefer the train. But whenever I ride Amtrak, I always have to come up with ""What I am paying extra $75 for"". Otherwise I feel that I wasted money. Because it only shaves 30min at most from bus ride, $75 is for 30min faster ride won't be a good reason for it.Here are my reasons : 1. More leg rooms. Between the seats are definitely wide than the bus. 2. I can read books without getting motion sickness.  than the bus. However,3. Being able to piss without stabilizing myself by pushing the wall with one hand and one foot like I do in Fung Wah bus.4. Because of reason #3, I don't have to wait til I arrive to the shitty Chinese buffet restaurant in Manchester CT for bathroom break.5. I can drink beer to make travel time fly or even fall asleep easier.6. Space is wide enough to open the laptop and work.7. No need to deal with traffic jam.So basically, I am paying $10 each for those benefits I value. What are yours?"
117,yelp.com,"I recently took the Amtrak Northeast Regional train between Boston and Providence. I was pretty impressed...the train was exactly on time going both directions, and it was a comfortable ride. Previously, I've had much worse luck with timeliness when using Amtrak in the Chicago area. I would definitely take Amtrak again to get to Providence and other nearby locations. However, I think I'll stick to the buses for travel between Boston and NYC just because of the extreme cost difference."
118,yelp.com,"Horrible customer service and a miserable riding experience. I tried an Amtrak route from Eugene OR to San Jose CA. The train was dirty - the bathrooms unacceptably so. The food offered on board was of worse quality than packaged convenience store food. The seats were not comfortable enough for their intended use (overnight rides). Our return trip was delayed repeatedly, and due to the uncertainty we ended up needing to rent a car and drive overnight to get home. I have still never received a refund for this awful experience. I cannot speak to other routes, but I would not recommend the Amtrak Coast Startlight to anyone for any reason, and will never use Amtrak again."
119,yelp.com,"How does a train that has no traffic run a half hour late?That, coupled with the Lake Shore Limited removing business class, reflects my review.  I did get my own seat up until Worcester, and sitting with someone else wasn't a problem, but I liked the business class room, and that, on top of how late the train ran (one would think that there were times there for a reason) reflect my drop off in review.  For the time I needed it, Amtrak worked out.  However, I'd have to consider the bus in the future, as at least in that case I have a better sense of when I'll arrive."
120,yelp.com,"Amtrak!I just took the train to get back to the wonderful world of Western Massland (it's a magical place beyond the barrier of 128, where the game of basket-ball was born).  In terms of simply this one route, a few things immediately spring to mind:1. I didn't have to wait in traffic.2. For just higher than the price I paid to get the privilege of being on a cramped coach bus, I was able to get a ticket upgrade to Business Class (it's Business Class!).3. AC plugs!  There's no wireless, but if you prepare right (and by prepare right, that means bring DVDs), you can get through the trip fine.I don't know what the Coach ride is like, but I did appreciate my business class ride."

145,yelp.com,"We recently took our second long distance ""USA Rail Pass"" journey. Beginning in Albany New York where we traveled on the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago then onto the Empire Builder which eventually took us to Seattle WA, although we stopped at a few places along the way in Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. We booked sleeping cars on most of the segments, which means you got all your meals included and because on the way back we stayed on the train throughout our trip, (Seattle to Chicago and Chicago back to Albany NY.) you pay only one fee for your accommodations. Keep in mind you're on a train, and sleeping in relatively small quarters is not for everyone, but it works. 95% of the employees are great!!! Food was pretty good! My only issue is apparently on some routes, including the Lake Shore Limited, they're trying something new. Meals are pre-packaged, and the menu is limited, but it was surprisingly good! Definitely better than airline food. The scenic views from the train are fantastic and you end up socializing a bit. You can't beat it! I know the equipment is old but very clean and updated. What most people don't like about train travel are the delays, which has nothing to do with Amtrak. They can't help it. ---Other than The Northeast Corridor and Keystone Corridor. both of which Amtrak owns, ---the rails are owned by Freight Railroads, which put their trains first, for the most part. All in all, we loved it. Hopefully, in the near future, Amtrak will get the funding it needs."
146,yelp.com,"Review of Amtrak NorthEaster train from BOS to NYC.By far, the best way to go from BOS to NYC.  Sure buses are cheaper, but Amtrak offers more room, open cars, dining options, very comfortable seating, work table/tray, and more.  Do yourself the favor, and go by train.Con's to the trip are few but include multiple stops at stations along the way, but that's really about it.  Some of the cars may not be plush or have tables for group work space, but they're decent none the less."

150,yelp.com,"I love trains (Sheldon and I would get along very well I think!). Now, I'm not talking about Metro... No no, I don't care about those. I'm talking about the regional ones that travel interstate.We took the Acela Express from Boston to NYC and the ride was so cool. I like how they have a compartment near the door for you to store your luggage. There's free Wi-Fi, which is always a winner. It's also very spacious between seats so you really feel comfy in your seats. The train was really clean and the bar at the back is great if you want to grab a drink or some food. Our train was on time and the ride was pretty quick although I wouldn't have cared if it took a bit longer though because the view was very nice. I'm definitely doing that again on my next visit and I might even do a night trip."
151,yelp.com,"Going from Boston to NYC was a little longer than I expected, about an hour delay total to reach Penn Station from South Station.  The train departed on time but we had several delays along the way, likely because of the snowfall.  The door got stuck on part of the trip so it was rather cold in the car I was ridding in plus it was packed so there was no room to sit elsewhere.  The ticket taker, seemed to have a bit of a problem when I asked how many more stops before Penn station (the speaker in the cabin was broken) so I had to ask the guy to repeat himself which he clearly did not like.  Next trip, I will likely pay for the 'upgrade' and see if I can have a bit of a better experience as there will be a need to do the Boston to NYC trip again before heading back to Atlanta.  Flying is too much of a hassle (cab(s), security, delays, etc...) for such a short trip so I am really hoping to make the best of a train ride."
152,yelp.com,"I have just had the worst customer service experience of my entire life. I purchased a ticket for a friend and it was attached to mine. The next day I needed to cancel my friends ticket and keep mine. I purchased insurance for the tickets and this insurance was purchased through the Amtrak website in the Amtrak checkout. I did this knowing I may need to cancel my friends ticket and felt better knowing I was covered and took the appropriate action. I called to cancel the ticket and was told that there would be a cancellation fee. I said I purchased insurance and that fee shouldn't apply. That is when I was told the insurance what outsourced. I said that was not made clear and I just wanted my ticket refunded. She said she couldn't help me and transferred me. I then spoke to a man that said no I would be reinbursed fully and he would facilitate the whole process, and then he promptly hung up on me and I ended up with another person and I had no idea who it was and they had no idea what was going on. I had to re-explain the whole story and was told they were insurance, and would not refund me, and that my insurance was not one that covered cancellation for miscellaneous. I then called Amtrak back, rexplained the whole thing and asked for a manager. I was told okay and transferred again. I again was with ANOTHER agent that I had to re-explain AGAIN the whole story and was told I could not speak to a manager and could not be refunded. May I also say the entire time all of this happened, every single agent was rude, aggressive, and condescending. At this point I was so frustrated and upset that I was crying. I told her that I had been put through the ringer, misinformed multiple times, the purchasing of the insurance and it's nuanced policies and outsourced nature was not made clear when I PURCHASED IT THROUGH AMTRAK. I said that I just wanted the 20 dollar cancel fee waved due to the lack of clarity in insurance policy and the horrible customer service. She transferred me to customer service. There I AGAIN explained it all, listened to the same cycle of rude, condescending banter. I made it clear what I wanted and why I felt it was warranted to have my fee waved.  The customer service agent then said ""I won't refund you because someone was rude"" in a mocking tone which tells me that she missed everything I told her about what I've been through or how I felt, and I felt it was an extremely inappropriate response for a customer service agent to provide. At this point I had spoken to 6 people, spent an hour, and needed to leave to go to my grandfathers funeral  and I freaked out and hung up. I am at a loss right now. This totally sent me over the edge and it was jarring to go through 6 people that could have helped me, yet refused to- OVER 20 DOLLARS ON THEIR END. Ultimately, this process cost me 40 dollars- 20 dollar cancellation fee and the 18 dollars I spend on insurance that wasn't even effective for what I wanted. I tried to do the right thing- I paid extra for insurance, I spoke to multiple agents and the insurance company, I made it clear exactly what I was seeking and why, and was met with derision, insult, and poor service. This is all over a train ticket. I wanted the 20 dollars back for my train ticket cancel fee, but apparently failure on the companies part to fully inform and serve customers is irrelevant. I hope you guys enjoyed that hour of my life,  my 40 dollars, and listening to me cry. Thanks."
153,yelp.com,"I sometimes love amtrak, and other times hate it! When heading from Boston to other cities, it is mostly on time at South Station/Back Bay! However, coming back from NYC or PVD is an entirely different story.They might be delayed by 100% of the time it takes you to get to your destination. Meaning, I've had to wait for close to an hour in Providence for the train to get there. I love what they have done with the application! You can buy tickets, scan them, and earn rewards, all linked to the app. I suggest signing up for amtrak guest rewards and catch their deals. You can also use your points to travel with them. Amtrak is clean, fast, and.. for the most part.. reliable."

175,yelp.com,"When heading to NY, you really can't beat the Acela Express.  True, it costs about the same as a flight, and takes a bit longer (but not much, when considering getting to and from the airport), but it drops you right in midtown at Penn Station, has comfortable seats, WiFi, and power outlets. Sure, you can't stream much video or music, but you generally can't do this on shared WiFi anyway.  Also?  There is a bar.  And a quiet car, if being next to people making noise makes you stabby.  Upgrade to first class, and get a free ""meal,"" but also free booze along the way."
176,yelp.com,"Amtrak Acela service from New York Penn Station to Boston is an expensive, but generally acceptable, trade-off.  When all factors of airline travel are considered, a flight has difficulty bettering the four hour Acela transit time.  While the endless miles of railroad siding and forest don't qualify as quality ""scenery,"" they better the view from ""the friendly skies"" by a wide margin.Acela seating is comfortable, with both foldout desktop and electrical power outlets supporting productive work.  The train seems to stop in every village and hamlet along the way, but they are better than the airlines at acknowledging that an actual on-time schedule exists.  I've traveled to several of the Boston Area train stations, and each time was only a quick cab ride to/from where I needed to be.  Compared to the airport experience, Amtrak wins.The Acela trains have ""quiet cars,"" and the majority of their inhabitants seem to grasp the concept.  There are also dining cars, where you can be gouged for substandard food, if you wish.  In particular, the microwaved hot dogs are beyond rubbery.  As with contemporary airline travel, you'll probably want to pack a sandwich."
177,yelp.com,"::This review is specifically for the Acela::Recently, I took the Acela train from Boston to New York City--and let me just say that as much as I love to fly, I would much rather take this train.With a super smooth ride, business class seating, and friendly service I cannot complain about the travel. With a first class feel and making convenient stops, you can't really beat the Acela. Sure it's more expensive, but consider this. In NYC, they drop you off/pick you up in Manhattan--no need for $40 cab rides to and from the airport. In Boston, it stops at Back Bay before ending at South Station--red line or orange line--you choose!Train over plane seems blasphemous, but it's true when traveling to Manhattan. If money is your concern, then just take a ride on the Fung Wah or Lucky Star. Airports really aren't worth the hassle for travel between Boston & NYC."
178,yelp.com,"Wow, the Acela has really improved since it first started operating.  I rode it from Boston to NY Penn on a beautiful sunny clear afternoon last week.  Got a regular ticket (not first class) for only $115, and I can't imagine any way the first class could have been any more comfortable than my seat was.  I always ride in the first car because it's the least full.  I always try to sit on the coast side when traveling southbound and inland side traveling northbound (that goes for the entire Northeast Corridor).  My favorite thing about Acela now is the very detailed trip-tracker map you can follow on your laptop or tablet.  Wifi included and two plugs for charging.   I applaud Amtrak for making improvements to this train ... it's really a pleasure to ride now."
179,yelp.com,"Going from Boston to New York, this really is the luxury way to travel.Sure, you could take a Chinatown bus for dirt cheap, but it might catch on fire and there's always the non-trivial probability of sitting next to a smelly crack dealer.And a flight is faster on paper, and often cheaper, but once you factor in the lines, the stress of airports, the groping TSA squad... how much is your sanity worth?I've even taken the overnight to the midwest for the holidays.  Cheaper than flying (ESPECIALLY during peak travel season), rather a bit longer, but MAN was it less stressful.  I just leaned back, plugged in my computer, chatted with the other passengers, and took naps.  It was quite pleasant.Of course, Amtrak has its difficulties.  It's horridly under-funded and has to share rails with freight.  But I blame that more on Republicans who'd rather subsidize a for-profit oil company than a public-service train company."
180,yelp.com,"Acela is the crown jewel of New York/Boston travel.  I have tasted paradise.  Too bad it's so expensive.  Fantastic speeds from the heart of one city to the heart of another!  Charming and witty fellow passengers!   Room to stretch your legs!  Opportunities for long, carefree strolls to the dining car!   Beautiful scenery, including segments where the windows overlook the Atlantic Ocean!  Food and drinks available whenever you choose!  In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm drafting this slightly romanticized review on my phone while sitting on a cramped bus, somewhere outside New Haven."

The seats are very comfortable and wide. They are upholstered in blue leather and have good recline. The leather is in good condition and the windows are large. AC adapters are present which is excellent. On a plus side the First Class car was pretty much empty. The over heads also have ample room to fit a Tumi Alpha Continental Carry On or even larger. It does not seem as if Amtrak is policing the hand luggage policy. The bathroom is large and well lit, but really needs to be inspected and cleaned more often. Not to be picky but the first class bathroom shouldn't have used towels on the counters and the trash overflowing.*Also not a problem on my ride since the carriage was pretty much empty, but the original seat I decided to sit in had coffee spill marks and crumbs all over the carpet. Amtrak should take a bit more time tidying the train after each run. This could have caused some issues if the train was full.Food:The food was good and very similiar when compared to United's trans con flights in United First. The best part was getting a proper sized wine glass not one of dinky tiny sample glass when you fly. I was pretty full so order some light cheese and crackers. The crackers were packaged and the cheese was served at an appropriate temperature and had a good texture and color. As mentioned the tray tends to run across the table because of the trains vibration. A possible solution could be using a dinning table cloth as the airlines provide. It was nice to receive proper metal utensils and quality dinning linen. Service:5 of 5 for service. The cabin attendant was excellent. She personally introduced herself to each passenger which was about 5 and took our orders. Routinely made rounds and refiled the wine. Amtrak is not stingy at all in this area. I think by the time ended I was clearly buzzed. Thank goodness I was taking a cab at my destination. The happy cheer personality and service attitude seemed truly genuine throughout the journeyOther:As a whole I was pretty happy, but for the price paid I might consider Acela Business Class on my next trip."
182,yelp.com,"I love Amtrak! It's the most comfortable way to travel. I've taken the Acela and the Northeast Regional coach seats numerous times,  as well as the Vermonter (8 hours, NY to VT, both coach and business class) twice.The Amtrak ride is pretty smooth, with little traffic, and the trains don't have that stinky bus smell like, well, a bus. Plus, a good portion of the NY-Boston trip is next to the water, so you get a pretty view, too. The Vermonter travels mostly through the woods, which is also pretty to look at, until it gets dark out. Then the impressive darkness is only punctuated by a few cute towns and the light from houses.My favorite part about taking Amtrak is the AC plugs. I can plug in my laptop and watch movies. It's not 4 hours to NY...it's 4 episodes of ""Grey's Anatomy.""  The seats are roomy and comfortable, although in coach you can start feeling stiff after a few hours, though if the train's not crowded they let you lie down on two seats. Plus, the staff is always nice and the bathrooms are as clean as a moving bathroom will get. You can get snacks at the Cafe Car, but they are really expensive so I don't bother.  Their luggage policy is reasonably lenient, so you can bring a 2 suitcases plus a backpack and a laptop case. And if that second suitcase happens to be the laundry bag from your dorm room, Amtrak doesn't usually mind.The Acela train is definitely nicer than the regular cars they use, but it's not always worth the extra money. Beware of high-volume days when they rotate in the old coaches with the red seats-they're less comfortable and don't always have AC plugs. Also beware of the Quiet Car if you plan on making any noise whatsoever, since it's supposed to be ""library quiet"" and some passengers interpret that as ""morgue quiet.""  The Quiet Car varies from train to train (it's usually an end car though) so pay attention when the conductor announces where it is.Amtrak customer service is usually good about making ticket adjustments if you need to cancel or change your trip. All in all, the best way to travel."
183,yelp.com,"I'd never traveled Amtrak before, but this past September I needed to go one-way to Albany to meet my dad, and the $21 price was right, so I decided to try it. Bad idea!The problem wasn't just that my 11:30 train from Back Bay turned into a 6:30 bus from South Station (which it did).  Or that I had to stay in South Station all afternoon, when I was missing half a day of work for the trip at my office 5 minutes from the station (which I did). Because they wouldn't let us leave the station, even briefly, despite having no clear idea of what the problem was or how they would fix it, ever (which they didn't). Or that the maximum they can give you for your trouble is the price of your ticket (which it is).The main problem was how profoundly unconcerned the Amtrak personnel were with the plight of the 100+ passengers who spent 6+hours sitting groaning on the floor of the station (some with small crying children, some crying themselves). Even small airlines will usually give delayed passengers *something*: meal voucher, useless coupon, whatever. Amtrak didn't even give us updates unless we banded together, cornered someone, and acted belligerent.I still have my voucher they gave me for my next trip. Hmmm, the shredder at my office is looking hungry..."

206,yelp.com,"I love the Acela. Traveling between New York and Boston on a monthly or bimonthly basis, I've pretty much exhausted the options for inter-city transportation. Unfortunately, it seems that everything from the Fung-Wah to first class has it's drawbacks. On the low end, many of the bus lines are crowded, cramped, and on the slow side. On the high end you have flying which is much quicker but very expensive, which along with the hassle of TSA and the New York airports makes it hard to stand.Right in the middle you have the Amtrak/Acela lines. They are cheap-ish and offer a nice ride to and from Boston with one major advantage over all other methods of transportation: the ability to move around. I don't care what you take, everything will be delayed at one point or another. When that happens, I want to be able to walk around and stretch my legs from time to time. Since I'm 6'3"" being able to do this is a huge plus for me. Additionally the leg room is unparalleled.The one downside is that it's more than double the price of the next cheapest option. To this I say that I would rather drink 2-3 fewer drinks at a bar and ride up comfortably than be crammed on a bus and arrive tired and pissed off."
207,yelp.com,"I went to Virginia this summer to pick up my niece for a visit. Amtrak does not possess long distance fast trains like other industrialized areas of the world. They were surprised to hear that anyone could cover that distance in less than 13 hours. As a point of reference, the approximate 600 miles between Boston and Virginia takes 13 hours, or about 46 mph. The approximate 550 miles between Paris and Berlin takes 8 hours, or about 68 mph. A similar distance in Japan is as fast as the European trek. Spent a cold, uncomfortable night (in August... the A/C was blasting) without a footrest, which would have made all the difference in the world, woke up to decent coffee, but a horrible breakfast otherwise: full of high fructose corn syrup... who the heck needs that for yogurt and granola? But that was the best thing they offered, so that gives you an idea. The trains are not quiet at all and they made no effort to keep a noisy car and a quiet car, so your standard group of boorish jerks sat at one end of my car shouting at each other for several hours in what they apparently considered witty and erudite conversation between about midnight and 3am. The platforms at Back Bay Station are so poorly marked that I actually boarded a commuter train before realizing my mistake (and really, that of the conductor who looked at my Amtrak tickets and told me to get on the train). We had a forty minute stop in DC that they did not announce or explain. Some people apparently knew enough to get up, get off the train and get some semi-real food. I wish I had. The ride back with a 10 year old was a little bit better because at least I knew what to expect, so we had a blanket with us. I still needed a footrest. Seriously, a little pulldown bar would have really and truly made a huge difference. I felt bad for the group of college students who had no idea about the A/C who then spent time trying to make spare t-shirts into blankets. It's cheaper to take the train than to fly or drive. It's not as cheap as it is in other countries with faster trains, oddly enough. If I'd slept in my car I could've made it possibly cheaper to drive, but ... did I really want to spend 4 days driving up and down the eastern seaboard, 2 of those with a 10 year old? I thought about it, and decided the slowest train in the industrialized world was probably the best option. On the way back I refused to get off at Back Bay and went right into South Station, where I had to go anyway for the commuter rail back out to Worcester. It doesn't really matter which one you board/disembark at, apparently, so I would recommend South Station any day over the other."
208,yelp.com,"Boston- NYC: The train should have supposed to leave at 6:45 pm. It ended up 2 hours delay.

209,yelp.com,"I've been traveling on the Acela weekly for work now for about three months.  I am a HUGE fan of the train.My Comfort:+  I am 6'3"" and not particularly skinny.  I always have plenty of leg room and general comfort in the seats.+  The tray for the seats is also large enough to work comfortably.+  There are frequently tables available if I need one.+  The Quiet Car is awesome when I don't want distractions.+  The other cars are great if I'm going to be talking on the phone or just want background chatter.+  The cafe car is reasonably priced and much of the food is good.  Coffee, beer, fruit, hummus, yogurt, etc - all good.  The pizza and anything else that has to be microwaved is as a good as any frozen microwave food.My Time Spent:+ I can arrive at the station 6 minutes before the train leaves, buy a ticket and be on the platform before the train arrives.  Tell me again when you fly how soon before you actually take off that you arrive?+ My entire trip is enjoyable and productive time spent - for the entire time on the train.  When I think of taxi, check-in, security, gate, delay, boarding, take-off, flight, touch-down, exit, taxi - I can get about 20 minutes of decent time door to door for that entire experience.  When you consider delays it's often not even longer to take the train.-  They are doing some electrical work so it is standard to have a 10-20 minute delay.  But at least I'm in a comfortable seat working.The Experience:+  Oh my the fellow travelers are polite and friendly.  Courteous.  Conversing with strangers.  Offering help.  Maybe the same people would be a grouch or jerk on the plane - you know, small seats, security lines, delays.+  The view between Boston and New York is sometimes achingly beautiful, from seaside boats to harbors to marshes.The Cost:-  Yes, it is expensive, but not much more than a flight with airport and taxis.  I am happy to pay to keep the Acela running."
210,yelp.com,"I had my first Amtrak experience on Friday and it was very good.  I wish I had taken it home too but I didn't.  I went to CT from Boston, and it was a quick and smooth ride (unlike buses, yack).  The guys on the train were wicked friendly.  There was adequate space above to put my bag as well as space to put my second bag underneath my seat.  I loved the outlets available to charge my phone, plenty of leg room and room for the person in front to lean back, that was cool.  My trip was a little over two-two and a half hours, but it flew by.  It made maybe four or five stops before mine and it was continuing on to DC.  I really enjoyed the trip.  I would have taken it back to Boston but the price is what deterred me from that, it was very expensive."
211,yelp.com,"I am losing faith in my favorite mode of transportation.  As I write this, the train is lumbering along at a healthy 15 to 20 miles per hourGood thing it's the Acela or I may be going backwardsMy last trip was delayed 2 hours as we sat in the train waiting for a locamotiveThese two incidents have allowed me sufficient time to ponder Amtraks main weakness: lack of communication to it's passengers about problems and lack of service recovery....Way back was way better...Changing tickets lacks the hassle of airlines and Conductor Bob was a tripFaith somewhat restored"

213,yelp.com,"Good stuff, not-so-good stuff about Amtrak...but mostly good stuff. Before 1997 my trips on Amtrak were far fewer but since my sister moved to NYC back then I've become a more frequent rider. I've taken other forms of transportation to Manhattan and points south but I'd recommend Amtrak over the rest.Good stuff? Ticketing and booking reservations is easy, as is changing a reservation. Employees at the stations and aboard the trains are friendly, knowledgable, and take pride in serving the public. That counts for a lot. Aboard the train there's room to use one's laptop, sleep without becoming too cramped, and a cafe car to get a snack, sandwich, or cocktail. When the train is moving the ride is relatively comfortable and passengers aren't tossed around. And the view...on the way down the Connecticut shoreline is so close you could touch it.That said, there are a few things that take away from what could be an almost perfect travelling experience. The on-time performance of Amtrak trains in the Northeast isn't great. I have dealt with delays of between 20 minutes and 2 hours a number of times in the past couple of years and I hope they'll cease. The train schedule is adequate but would be vastly improved by the addition of a couple of more trips, especially one that would leave Boston earlier on weekday mornings. Prices aren't exactly cheap, but can be justified by a ride superior to driving a car down Route 95 or taking the bus into NYC.A couple of tips...embarking at either Route 128 in Westwood or at Back Bay Station means you can avoid the South Station crowds. Granted, you may not get your choice of seats, but these stations are still convenient to Boston. Also, on your way to Boston...try to get aboard a train that originates at Washington, DC. Generally the trains that start south of there must travel on CSX tracks and that arrangement sometimes causes delays for the Amtrak trains."
214,yelp.com,"The Acela is by far the easiest most painless way to get to and from Manhattan. Hands down. Sure, it can be a little late getting out of Penn Station, but at least you are at Penn Station, not stressed out, stuck in a cab on your way to JFK where you will wait and wait and wait for your JetBlue plane to take off. Once you sit down, you can tune out, stretch out, chill out, and enjoy the ride. I've been more relaxed riding the train than most anywhere else in recent memory. A great time to read, do some work, or get loaded in the cafe car. Contrast this with the tragicomedy of flight attendants rushing to dole out beverages on the ascent  out of Boston only to collect your cup a few minutes later as the seatbelt sign illuminates and you prepare to queue up for a cab to get to your meeting in NYC.The scenery coming from Boston in the morning is, frankly, breathtaking, and passing by coastline feels civilized.  It's cheaper, easier, with no security thugs to inspect your dirty socks, and feels, gasp, continental. Imagine! Door to door I get to where I need to go in the same amount of time it would take via flying. No joke."
215,yelp.com,"Every mode of transportation between Boston and New York has its positives and negatives.  While I generally prefer flying into LGA on the Delta Shuttle, the Acela runs a close second in terms of how to get into the city.  The Acela leaves from South Station and Back Bay (since I live on the Orange Line I like to pick the train up there) and makes its journey to Route 128 and Providence before a few stops in CT and NY.  While the Acela is touted as a high speed train, it is hardly that (especially if you've ever traveled overseas and witnessed actual high speed train travel).  Once the train approaches Fairfield County in CT, it starts to share tracks with Metro North and subsequently never puts the ponies under the hood to the test.  It is a far more comfortable ride than the Regional, it saves you about 20 minutes, but it also costs a bit more.  The good news is that you don't need to fit your toiletries in three-ounce bottles, you don't have to take off your shoes at security, and you are free to walk around during the journey.  There is a cafe car with some food and beverages, though the food is a bit lackluster, so I usually pack my own provisions.  The quiet car is also a great feature, as it pretty much becomes the Bates Reading Room at the Copley Library.  The other cabins may mean you overhear some conference calls and sales pitches while you are on your journey.  You have ample leg room and you don't have to worry about someone getting annoyed when you recline your seat.  At the end of your trip from Boston, you are conveniently dumped out at Penn Station which is a great springboard for getting around the rest of the city."
216,yelp.com,"First experience with amtrak: pleasant, but other than the sale of beer and food car, not much different than a bolt bus.Until... the lines broke in New Haven. Delayed indefinitely. I had to spend the night there, and because they still hadn't fixed the problem the next morning, had to buy a bus ticket to NYC. fast forward to TWO MONTHS and well over six hours of time on hold trying to reach customer service reps:They finally call me. The rep can't find my reservation, so she requests my credit card number. I told her it would take a minute or two to bring it up, and she threatened to hang up on me. Yes, after well over six hours on hold for her, she is going to hang up on me after two minutes. Eventually, she told me the only thing she could get me were  two $100 vouchers.I am out over $500 for this entire experience. I now have two $100 vouchers that will expire in January.

237,yelp.com,My son (!4) and I rode the Acela to NY for a quick day trip. I was in Boston for business and he had come along.  I grew up in NYC and we had to take the opportunity to go to NYC even for just 6 hours. We are also big train fans (we once rode the California Zephyr from San Francisco to Denver) so taking the Acela was a must even if all we did was turn around and come back. We were staying in the back Bay and could have gotten on there but we wanted to start from the beginning and make sure we got a good seat for the trip. When heading south to NY sit on the left side so you can see the shore when it's possible. The train itself is very cool looking and the interior has a business jet feel. Big comfy seats and lots of room and wifi and power at each row. I download an app for my iPhone that showed our speed. The stretch between Boston and Providence is the quickest. We hit 150 for a bit. In a plane you have no concept for how fast thou are going at high altitude. But in this train going even 135 feels really fast. There are many business people and they talk on the on the phone (a lot!) so if you want quiet sit in the quiet car. Cafe car has standard Amtrak fare so if you want something better get it at the station. Bathrooms are nice and big. Our train to NY arrived 30 minutes late so my son and I really had to book it to Yankee Stadium so we didn't miss our tour. Our return train later that night (7PM) was also late arriving from DC but it managed to arrive at Boston Back Bay on time. I really didn't care that it was late as we were on an adventure together. It was all part of a really memorable trip my son and I will cherish for many years.
238,yelp.com,"Bad customer service - STILL, after all these years.But - if you need to get back home to Connecticut from Boston (after flying into Logan like I did) -  it's a lot better than Greyhound, and is one of your only options.The trains out of Boston are ALWAYS crowded, so grab a seat fast - as it's first come first served.TIP: leave out of South Station (if you can), as opposed to Back Bay - as you'll get first dibs on the seats that way.The Acela is way overpriced - don't bother. Go with the local runs - as the service is just as lousy (either way), and you'll get to your destination not all that much faster, anyways."
239,yelp.com,"First class Amtrak.  Much different than the other seats?  More leg room?  Mediocre food.

If traveling from NY to Boston, or vice versa, take the Acela. Otherwise, this trip could feel like eternity! Upgrade to first class, splurge - it's worth it."

241,yelp.com,"Just finished a trip from Boston south station with a connection in Chicago to San Francisco. If I had to do it again, I would fly to Chicago and do the 2 nights to California from there. Let me first say the sleeper on the Boston to Chicago leg was actually a few inches bigger than the Chicago train. That being said there were a couple of things that were terrible about the Boston leg....1- the sleeper car was RIGHT BEHIND the locomotive car! Not so good. They literally blew the horn every few minutes ALL NIGHT LONG. 2- there was no proper mining car on the Boston leg. Which meant all meals were literally microwaved. Yeah. Which had this been a camp ground or a hostile I wouldn't care. But for what we paid.... Onto the good. And there was a lot good, cool, fascinating about it. Our car attendants (both legs) were excellent! Turn down service, answer questions, explaining things about trains etc. sense of humor. We asked for extra pillows and viola! Pillows. I would suggest that if you like air flow; bring a personal fan. There is outlets in each room. They cannot possibly please everybody on the car with temps. And both my husband and I run HOT. We have a fan going all winter (and we live in NE). The first leg each room had a toilet. Which was great for my 2x pee in the middle of the night. The views were pretty cool. People were rather friendly. The observation lounge was nice. There was a cafe underneath it for light snacks & beverages of all types. It was rather relaxing. Meals were pretty good for a train. They were cooked to order. Dinners are done by reservations. Or you could have your room attendant bring dinner to your room. We did that 50% of the time. Plan on always being seated with other travelers. If there are 2 in your party you will be seated with another party of 2. If there are 3 they will stick a single person with you etc. they have limited seating. It is what it is. I'm very outgoing and it wasn't my favorite part. However, we did meet some fascinating people. Which gave us some interesting conversations. My husband is much more shy then me; so we opted for 50% of meals in dinner car. Dessert comes with every meal. Except breakfast. Each car attendant brews fresh coffee each morning for their car. Which was great! Bathrooms were kept shockingLY clean for a train. All in all, great experience. Would highly recommend."

Getting from Boston to Portland was a breeze, even found a seaside carnival to try for another day that's a different stop along the way.No real complaints except i was supposed to get back to North Station at 10:25....11:30 is not even close."
243,yelp.com,"my  sister did not feel like going to the airport, so...I was perfectly happy with the cost, service and process for taking the amtrak train from south station to penn station nyc. while waiting for the train, the ""red hats"" (the men from amtrak who help with luggage) came around to check on us and offered to take our things pronto.the train ride was smooth and quiet. we sat in the ""quiet car"" no cell phones and only quiet conversatiions. great for working, reading or napping (my favorite of the 3).the snack car had some decent items (the turkey sandwich and trail mix were yummy). also the banana was super-fresh, not gone bad....i would definitely take/recommend amtrak."

245,yelp.com,"I travel for work from Boston to Philadelphia a few times a month.  I usually take the Acela down, it takes about 5 hours to arrive in Philly and 4 for Penn Station.  Its a pretty smooth ride.  I bring my laptop with me.  They have plugs at every seat in Business and first class.  If you have a wireless card through a cell phone company you can get internet the entire way.  Each car has a bathoom.  There is usually a cafe car where you can get some food or beer/wine.  If you sit in the first class car, all food & drinks are complimentry (included in the price of your ticket).Amtrak also has a pretty good rewards program.  So if you do it enough you can earn points."
246,yelp.com,"After years of the Fung-Wah, the Greyhound, the Peter Pan, and now Bolt and Megabus, I had the opportunity to take the Amtrak to NYC for a business trip. I was nervous: would we get along? Could this be... The One? With butterflies in my stomach, I prayed, ""Be gentle - it's my first time.""Slowly but surely the Amtrak seduced me with its shiny steel frame, the electrical sockets by each seat, the ample legroom and storage space for luggage - the snack car that served alcohol! With such proper lubrication, I just lay back and let Amtrak take me for four and a half hours. I walked off the platform in a haze, wondering why I had stayed away for so long. 'Cause once you go Amtrak, you never go back."

268,yelp.com,"This was my first experience taking the Acela Express from Boston to NYC. I've had no problems with the shuttles from Logan, but this time I needed to end up right in Times Square so I figured it was worth a shot. All seats are ""business class"", but I think once everyone becomes ""special"" it's pretty clear that nobody is. The seats are fairly spacious and comfy, but I'm not sure what is ""business class"" about them. I guess they aren't the plastic benches on the T buses. There is also constant minor turbulence from the track, but really this should be expected. Finally, aside from cruising pretty fast from Boston to Providence this train has not been very ""express"", particularly on some really slow stretches through CT. The food is atrocious. I was starving so I settled on a chef salad and the ONLY salad dressing option was ""Buttermilk Farms"" which essentially was mayo mixed with more oil. Disgusting. It's nice to have internet the whole time, but that connection is spotty at best. It took about 5 minutes to load yelp and login, but there isn't really anything else to do. Overall it's not a terrible experience, but I think I'll stick with the airport shuttles and deal with potential delays and TSA nonsense."
269,yelp.com,"I like the train.  Its more expensive then the bus, much more expensive, but its a little safer and much much much more comfortable. Its clean, comfy, the bathrooms smell nice(!!!) and its on time.  The Amtrak employees are a mix.  Boston ones were much nicer then the gate agents at Penn station. Trains have electric outlets for you laptops.  Each train has a quiet car and a snack car, so you can get some hot tea or a bagel.  You can reserve a table and have a real meal, or some variation of it.   I would give them five stars if they would post the track # a little earlier then 10 min to departure.  Its quite chaotic.  Once they post it, and god forbid you are standing in the wrong place, the crowd will mow you down and noone would even blink an eye.  So, location, location, location, eyes on the table, and once you see the track number posted, run for your life."
270,yelp.com,"First time riding a train and it went well.Arrived at Boston South Station and was issued a ticket from the ticketing agent. The station is nice with an abundant food court and monitors everywhere. Almost missed my train because I was too busy yapping on the phone to a friend about people lining up on the tracks. After hanging up and checking the monitors, realized, hey! those people are taking the same train as me and it's about to leave! Made it onboard with less than a minute to spare.Coach seating is ample big. Much better than flying. Free wifi and AC plugins on the Acela Express.What was really nice was that when we approached my stop, the conductor stopped by my seat and reminded me that the next stop would be where I was getting off. Fantastic service!"
271,yelp.com,"Sure, I would LOVE to review Amtrak in lieu of finishing my thesis.Yes, it is more expensive than flying. Usually a round-trip ticket for me from Boston to Philly is $150ish; Acela is obviously another $80 or so. But, if you consider the amount of money spent getting to and from the airport--especially given the Silver Line's shiteous history of shitosity--it evens the gap a bit.Also consider not having to go through security, removing your shoes on the one day you wore mismatched, holey socks, taking off all your jewelry, forgetting your belt buckle, having to go back through security, alarm goes off again, TSA employee motions you to the side and starts wand-ing you, something in your chestal region goes off, she starts patting you down on the one day you've only worn an old, sweaty undershirt, and after all that, you discover that the underwire in your bra is poking out and that's what's making the alarm go off, but first, you had to suffer a major loss of time and embarrassment because everyone boarding the same JetBlue flight as you knows that you have a gigantic toe-hole in your sock-piece.Plus South Station has an Au Bon Pain.I've only ever been delayed 20 minutes on the train. Perhaps I've been lucky, but I rarely hear horror stories.The trains are comfortable, I love the quiet car, and the humming of the tracks and the wind is quite calming. I like."
272,yelp.com,"I am currently resting my ass on a horizontally friendly leather seat, stopping myself from laughing at my neighbor as she googles - I shit you not - the phrase ""hemorrhoid cream side effects."" THANK THE SWEET LORD FOR WIFI ON ACELA! It's about time you listened, Amtrak.Let me backtrack: I have been travelling to New York almost every weekend on business. I prefer the car as I can get door-to-door in 3 hours for the price of an Indian lunch buffet, but since my car was murdered by an enormous pine tree a few weeks ago, I have had to resort to public transportation.Being a cheap college senior in a recession, I generally opt for the $15 Bolt bus which features electrical outlets and wifi, but the speed, accessibility, and comfort of Amtrak, particularly its Acela line, are too great to overlook. For half the price of a plane ticket, I can sit back, relax, and occasionally get some work done.Amtrak has made some improvements in the past few months, too. For one, they have decreased  their one-way ticket prices by about 25% (from about $93 to $79 depending on how early you book). Secondly, they have a generous Amtrak Rewards program for frequent travelers (e.g. I received a free round-trip ticket from Boston to New York after only three trips). Finally, and most importantly, they have armed their travelers with WIFI access, giving them the tools to cure hemorrhoids one Google search at a time.Thank you, Amtrak. You are so worth the money now."
273,yelp.com,"""We'll have to wait until the power comes on, but it won't be more than a minute after that.""  I was in the café car heading from Boston to NYC this morning, and had just ordered up a sausage, egg, and cheese for breakfast.  It's been a long time since I took the train and I forgot how Euro it makes me feel.  The ding of the microwave cut my dreams of northern Italy short and the friendly cashier handed over the perfectly wrapped Jimmy Dean breakfast Sammy.  ""It's hot"" she said.  My brother was with me too, and ordered the same thing.  Plenty of booths were open in the car, so we set up shop somewhere near Kingston, R.I. and took in the sites of the coast, the sounds of the train, and the pungent smells of the sausage.  My god it smelled outrageous.Crossing into Connecticut, the sun was strong and illuminated the contents of my now unwrapped breakfast.  Inside, a disturbingly well proportioned biscuit, egg, sausage patty, and cheese slice sat in all its glory.  Piping hot and oh so fragrant the temptation was overwhelming.  I dove in.  Soft but firm, like a Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpet with more salt.  Yes I was starving, and my strike zone was huge, but I can say without hesitation that this particular sandwich was absolutely delicious.This sandwich was constructed in Illinois, or so it said on the wrapper.  How they crafted 4 individual ingredients to be the exact same circumference, to the mm, I'll never know.  About the same width as a tennis ball, I am certain I could slide four, maybe five if I press, of the sandwiches into an empty tennis ball can.  Half way through, I was impressed with how well everything stayed together, no mess, a perfect snack for a train.  At just under $5, I couldn't have asked for more.  Had I not been fighting motion sickness from traveling backwards and smelling sausage this entire time, I would have ordered up another.In short, I can recommend the SEC Sammy on the Amtrak train."

Ugh. Waste of money."
275,yelp.com,"I've taken both the Acela and regional trains to NYC...and there has been only one time that I have actually arrived on time, without delay. It's a frustrating experience to be caught on a train...it's much like traffic except I don't have a horn to honk angrily while shaking my fist at the gods. This last time, I purchased two tickets from Boston to NYC on the regional 6:45 pm train on a Friday night. Things were looking great! I printed my tickets at the kiosk, the train arrived right on time, we found good seats a couple cars away from the snack car and the first hour of travel was smooth. And then came New London...A mile outside the New London stop, with people standing in the aisles, lining up to jump of the train...we screech to halt. 20 minutes later...we're still not moving. But why? We don't know. 40 minutes later a tinny voice comes on and inaudibly describes something over the loudspeaker and then the power shuts off. The car becomes incredibly hot and uncomfortable. While the electricity is off the voice comes back and says - oh hi...we have a disabled train in front of us that is on a dead track and can't get powered back up. We are basically trying to juice up and jumpstart that train to get things moving again. At this point, it was time to start drinking. Thank God that Amtrak not only serves beer and wine, but they serve hard liquor as well. A glass of wine and a gin and tonic later...the hour and a half that we spent sitting on the train didn't seem so bad. Except that I was sweltering hot and desperately wanted to strip to my skiivies.We arrived not at 10:45pm as expected, but at 12:15am. Not the best experience on Amtrak I've had...Bolt Bus is climbing the food chain."
276,yelp.com,"Amtrak offers two trains out of South Station: Regional Service (to/from Washington via New York and the once a day train to/from Chicago) and the Acela (also known as the ""fancy"" train).The duration of each trip is about the same (3.5 hours for the Acela, and 4-4.5 on the Regional), but the service is worlds-apart.I've been fortunate enough to take the Acela First Class (the rest of the train is Business Class), which included the following highlights:- Access to the Acela Lounge, a nice pre-waiting area with snacks and beverages away from the hordes of other passengers (essentially, Amtrak's answer to the Admiral's Club)- Priority Boarding- Deluxe leather seating, either in 1 or 2 seat configurations (I secured a single seat row)- Gourmet meal (I had a salmon lunch with risotto)- Open barService was exquisite and it was a nice way to travel to New York for my birthday.  They were quite generous with the drinks, too, and I felt no pain very quickly.  There's no shame in drinking at 11 AM!My experiences on Acela Business Class and the Regional have both been extremely positive.  My favorite part of train travel is avoiding security lines and wait times at the airport, the fact that I can use my computer (the Acela now has Wi-Fi), and the total trip time is still less if you consider everything it takes to board a plane.  Plus, there are usually no delays due to weather (except under extreme conditions).While the bus is the cheapest way to go, and flights might be less ""travel"" time, trains are a beautiful way to experience the trip.For a good discount on trains, check out the National Association of Railroad Passengers (NARP) for an ongoing 10% discount on the Regional and that discount on Acela (which almost NEVER has discounts) on weekends only.  It's $35 a year and you'll make it back in 2-3 trips.The biggest tip I can impart is book early!  Oh, and join Guest Rewards to earn free travel.  If you really travel a lot, also get the Chase card."

She said ""you had better look for it because our systems are down and I won't be able to find your details by name, email or telephone number"" and with that she hung up!!

I was not speaking to the woman who was ringing us up for the water, but to the person I was with, asking if she thought there might be a bathroom on the floor we were on. The woman ringing us up gave me the most dirty look, and said “this is a train, it’s not that hard to understand where the bathrooms are.” Overall one of the worst travel experiences of my life, and I’d recommend you keep your money and find an alternate experience as I will not be traveling with them again if I can avoid it."

289,trustpilot.com,"We bought ferry tickets from Seattle, WA to Victoria, BC at the start of July. We turned up to the ferry terminal with our tickets at the end of July, only to be told that our tickets were not valid, Amtrak sell duplicate/invalid tickets so there was no seat for us. We ended up stranded in Seattle. We ended up getting a 3hr bus journey with Greyhound to Port Angeles, WA and then a 3hr Black Ball ferry from Port Angeles to Victoria. We arrived in Victoria 10 hours later than we were meant to & we ended up missing out on visiting the Butchart Gardens as it had closed by the time we arrived in Victoria, so we also lost out on money for that too. Amtrak refunded the $253 cost of the fake tickets. However, refused any compensation for the inconvenience, time wasted, or the  visit to Butchart Gardens which we missed because of Amtrak selling us fake/invalid tickets. They offered a voucher for another Amtrak journey which is completely useless to us because firstly we’re from the UK & are unlikely to require train/bus/ferry transport in the USA anytime soon, but also suffice to say I will never use Amtrak again regardless of their coupon. I will also be telling anyone who asks to avoid this company at all costs because there was no way of knowing the tickets were invalid until we turned up for the time of the journey. Awful experience."

I entered very near the track my train was to depart from and confirmed with some passersby that that I was indeed heading to the right place. I then trekked around the station to see if I could get an Amtrak employee with a computer to confirm. With an eye roll, I was told that the ""DC train ALWAYS leaves from track 4."" Well, it didn't that day and I couldn't hear the announcement of a track change over the jackhammering going on due to construction in the station. I ended up getting on the wrong train and disembarked in Providence, RI. While I love Providence, I didn't plan on arriving in DC via points north. So now an extra 4 hours of my life are being taken up by the incompetence of the very company I am paying to transport me. Never again.

We were regulated to our assigned seats from the moment we entered, despite the car being empty. Our conductor was curt, somewhat rude and surly. No smile, no service. So business class on Amtrak is just an opportunity for Amtrak to earn more money. Maybe Amtrak should take lessons from world-class train services across the globe, to perhaps improve their service and their profitability. Next time, we will drive. It's cheaper and faster and we don't have to deal with disgruntled staff. ....Amtrak. Just an awful experience."

I was instructed by Amtrak staff at the train station to report the delay to Amtrak customer relations to either be refunded the cost of the trip or obtain a credit towards future trips. After waiting on hold twice for around 30 min, I was told that a delay of 43 min (the train made up for some of the delay) is not considered significant enough. I find this unacceptable. Any railway system in Western Europe and Japan would consider delays longer than 15 minutes as significant. Both delays were caused by equipment breakdown. Such a high frequency of failure is a sign of poor maintenance and/or antiquated infrastructure. It is all lagging many years behind the modern railways in other developed countries."

Their phones are busy and so you are waiting for a text response from them. I waited about 15 - 20 minutes before getting a text that asked for the last 4 digits of the card used to purchase the tickets. This required me to go upstairs, grab my husbands wallet to get his debit card (the one used), and in the time it took for me to do that, the person, texted, ""I'm sorry, since I haven't heard from you, I will be closing this chat.""      So, I'm now waiting for ANOTHER text response. I think after reading some of the other reviews, and my personal experience, I don't think we will do business with Amtrak in the future.

And the food service was excellent. But there were some downsides. As you've gathered from previous reviews, Amtrak operates on tracks owned by freight companies, and they are often delayed by freight traffic, in spite of federal laws to the contrary. Our trip was running about 4 hours late. The really odd, and unfortunate thing: We had to leave the train in Reno because there were not enough operating toilets. Amtrak bused us to Sacramento, and then we rode the Capitol Corridor to Emeryville. Running late was understandable, but still a big disappointment because we passed through some of the best scenery after dark. But the inoperable toilets is really hard to accept. Still, on balance it was a great trip."
310,trustpilot.com,"We have ridden Amtrak from AZ to KS a few times years ago, and loved it. Those times, very short...if any, delays. This year, family has taken it twice to come see us. First time, the train was 6 hours late due to a derailment, ok...understandable. Yet, it was also delayed by a few hours on her return ride home (this is about a 14 hour ride with no delays). Today, it is almost 10 hours late,  a series of issues apparently. We have to drive an hour to pick up family from the station. It was supposed to be in around 8:30 last night. It just arrived minutes before 6:00am this morning, now my husband (who is picking them up) is late for work. What should have been a 14 hour train ride turned into 24 hours...with little explanation as to why. We just can't rely on Amtrak now...ridiculous delays! We'll see how their return ride home goes."
311,trustpilot.com,Had a roomette. Nice but very tiny.Food horrible! Went from North Carolina to New Orleans…5 HOURS LATE GETTING INTO NEW ORLEANS.  Was NEVER given updates regarding delay! They should have to refund part of trip for that type of delay
312,trustpilot.com,If you are in a sleeper car and Manny is your attendant YOU HAVE JUST FOUND THE BEST ATTENDANT AT AMTRAK!!!! I’m on the Empire Builder 28 coming from North Dakota and heading to Chicago and I cannot say enough about the folks on this train from the conductor to the dining cart but especially Manny! Thank you Amtrak for the people on this train! They should be acknowledged for going above and beyond. See a lot of bad reviews and it wouldn’t be that way if the other trains and personnel took tips from the ones on this train! Thank you Manny!
313,trustpilot.com,"I had an excellent phone call with Francine, who booked my roundtrip reservation to San Francisco. I was planning to give her an excellent review, so I stayed on the line. However, the call was immediately disconnected, and so I am writing a review here. Francine was amazing! This has happened before. (The Amtrak system needs to make it easier to give customer feedback. In general, I love Amtrak!) Francine should be given a promotion. She is patient and kind but also efficient."
314,trustpilot.com,"My boyfriend had to go from Maine to NYC for surgery and I wasn’t able to accompany him due to health reasons, so I booked with Amtrak. He is an amputee of the left leg and has a motorized wheelchair. Amtrak booked a round trip ticket for him with handicap assistance first taking a bus from Portland Maine to Boston then Amtrak to NY. We were both very anxious about him going alone but Amtrak staff assisted him every step of the way even leading him onto the street and getting him a cab, they also met him at the train entrance for the return trip, assisted him onto the train and helped him get to the right bus in Boston. The phone agents we’re understanding, kind and helpful. All in all a very pleasant experience and very reasonable price 😊"
315,trustpilot.com,"Loved riding and seeing the landscape along the way.  I was surprised that absolutely no cleaning took place in common areas the entire 36 hour ride.  Bathrooms and observation car where in need of some serious cleaning. Some employs are rude and act like they hate their job. Second car attendant only got a little friendly when stopped and forced into conversation. First snack bar attendant was a ""starving actor"" and very entertaining. It seems for what we pay we should see more attention to cleaning and a few more 😃s."
316,trustpilot.com,"One of the delightful experiences of our Amtrak trip from Chicago to Upstate New York was the chance to meet Amtrak staff member Christian Moleon. He had style, dignity, and such a level of professionalism in staffing sleeper car 4812. We felt like he cared about us. He repeated offered assistance to us, anticipated our needs and responded to them, and made our trip so much more enjoyable. He was a memorable part of our trip. He GETS what providing a great customer experience is!  We hope we have the good fortune to travel with him again."
317,trustpilot.com,I am on your bus leaving Bakersfield.  It’s over 100 degrees here. Our bus is 5810 leaving to Los Angeles.  There are children and old people waiting outside while your driver sits inside in the air conditioning.  When I tried to ask him by knocking on the door why he wouldn’t let us in he ignored me. It was 1:56.  At 2:07 he opened the doors and got off.  When he got off he still wouldn’t let us in. When I asked why he said “if you don’t shut up I won’t let you on my bus.” He finally left late at 2:23 because he waited and left all of us out in the heat.  Whomever he is he should be fired.
318,trustpilot.com,"Let’s see…where to begin. Our ride out from Penn to Rochester.  We were 2 hours late into Rochester.  The cafe car had 6 or 7 tables. However, three were filled with employees who were very vocal with profanities about their employment. Another table was filled with files and paper work of another Amtrak employee.  Leaving two available tables for paying ticket holders.Return trip…Rochester to Penn.Fowl mannered cafe employee that was kirt, rude and short with me and a young lady in front of me.  Confirmed by my husband who also watched the same tone and manor to someone in front of him.Currently we are stuck at Utica station without electrical power.  And have been for 20 minutes which of course means we will not be on time into Penn station.Honestly this is so very sad!  I lived in Europe for years and never in all my train travels did any one of the issues occurred.It boggles the mind that Amtrak can not get their act together and provide an efficient and pleasant experience.Maybe the big bosses of Amtrak should head over to Europe and sit in on some meetings to see why things work so well, have pleasant even nice employees,  run on efficient time schedules, are cost affordable and overall just better at their train services. On a scale of 1 to 10. One being the best 10 the worst.  Amtrak falls at a 3 to me.And the only reason a 3 is because of the convenience of not driving."

Don't get me wron I have had  a few good ones. I also had some with bad attitudes. Most of all my experiences with Amtrak has been wonderful. My meals were very satisfying and delicious.  I was on the Coastal Starlight 02/27/23From Portland Oregon to Los Angeles CA. Please give Maggie 5 stars 🌟 for an excellent job well-done Bonnie King."
320,trustpilot.com,"We recently traveled from Santa Barbara to Seattle. Upgraded to business class as the literature clearly stated unlimited non alcoholic beverages and diner car access. Well the unlimited beverages consisted of a warm bottle of water handed to us as they checked our seats. No diner car access was ever allowed, mentioned or suggested! 32 hour train ride and any food we ate came off the Roach Coach under the observation car. Very disappointing as a first experience!"
321,trustpilot.com,"After being more than 2 hours late, at the horrible Anniston AL station, people are getting rushed onto the train, and before they can even sit down, the train is going! This includes folks w/ kids. Almost ZERO stops so people can have a smoke- making many passengers unhappy.  Food is over priced and not very good. A can of soda is 2.50!! Coffee is like mud. Next time I need to go on a long trip, I'll take a bus -because for the price of a train I expected better -as did most of the people I am hearing complain."
322,trustpilot.com,"I want to thank Red Cap Floyd who works at the 30Th Street Train Station in Philadelphia, Pa. Excellent Customer Service. He took very good care of us and personality plus. I hope I can get many more Red Caps like you Floyd. Also, a shout out for Kevin who worked as an attendant on the Crescent Train 19 On our way to Georgia was also ""Top Dollar"" Customer Service. I was overwhelmed with happiness Amtrak at 30th Street has stepped up a whole lot since I last ride the train which was about 7 years ago."
323,trustpilot.com,"Eh. Fancy new app which refreshes constantly and for what? The arrival time remains but unless the engine has us going faster than light we will be about 30 minutes late. Maybe it has better than light speed: it takes us around the earth backwards like Superman did until we’ve gone back in time 38 minutes Or the Star Trek thing where the train will fly around the sun and warp us back 38 minutes Or, we’ll just crawl into the station half an hour late while the app said nothing all along. Good job. Next time I’ll crawl on my hands and knees and prolly get there faster."
324,trustpilot.com,"Cafe car on 90 was out of all breakfast and dinner entrees from point of origin. Unacceptable but not surprising for AMTRAK these days.  At Florence crew change the Engineer was late, causing an 1/2-hour and still counting delay.  And the cafe attendant on 89, 1/24/2023, was surly."
325,trustpilot.com,"Roomette quarters very dirty. We travelled from Emeryville to Chicago on the California Zephyr in a roomette. The carpet was soaking wet as it had just been cleaned. The strong smell of disinfectant was testimony to this. However nothing else had been cleaned. As we were going to be enjoying the scenery I washed our window. I am hoping to include photos too at the end. The table had visible spill marks the walls had sticky dirty marks and the curtain was unsanitary. The communal toilets needed more cleaning attention too. Scenery was spectacular, food was good and the dining car staff were lovely. On one occasion I had to let the conductor know that the outside door in the sleeping quarters was left open, as we were travelling along. The second night was incredibly bumpy with lots of horn blowing. Be aware."
326,trustpilot.com,"An overpriced commute with stinky, dirty restrooms. Nobody for assistance and everything is to be purchased (Food, blankets, water,). A commercial train experience.We took Amtrak from NYC to Niagra. So, while on our way back to NYC at the Niagra Amtrack, we had to wait outside the Amtrack station. It was 2 in the morning weather being as bad as - 10 degree Celsius. The station was closed and would function from 3 am was written on the door which I would prefer to be mentioned on the website. We had to call the Police for assistance as our hands and feet were starting to feel numb. People traveling to Niagra Amtrack kindly note that the station works from 3 in the morning for passengers without staff in the building."

328,trustpilot.com,"Worse experience ever.  Never never again.  We were taking Amtrak from Denver to Grand Junction Co.  Train was leaving at 8:00am.  Received a robo call at 4:00am saying there was a delay.  Website said still on time.  Called at 6:00am and was told train delayed until 1:30pm.  No updates and when we got to the station we were told train was arriving at 4:30pm.  No help from staff, website.  Went to airport and rented a car.  Train route is supposed to be very scenic but be aware.  No communication."
329,trustpilot.com,"If I could rate negative 5 stars, I would. I've NEVER considered taking the train and after the poor (that's a stretch) customer service I experienced; I never will. I spoke with two reps on 4/14 and 4/15/23 (one of which spelled my name and email address incorrectly then abruptly ended the call). The second rep, although she resolved my issue, had just as horrible of an attitude and also ended the call abruptly... NEWS FLASH: Without patrons, you'd BOTH be unemployed. Hopefully these were two isolated incidents because I can't imagine paying customers actually put up with this condescending treatment."
330,trustpilot.com,"Kevin Linton made our experience amazing. Reluctantly, we took the train from NYC to Miami. My husband had hernia surgery and couldn’t carry our heavy bags and we didn’t want to check them. Kevin helped us so much. The entire trip he was always attentive to our needs, and was incredibly patient with us. Nothing was too much to ask from him. He seems like a very kind person and Amtrak is lucky to have him. He’s a keeper."
331,trustpilot.com,"i really love trains. Amtrak interface is awful in the app, and i have to search for hours how to apply the rail pass that i've just bought for xmas (your marketing team is on point). It's not in the same app for rail pass, i have to go to website and somehow seek to apply it. Most people are giving reviews about attendants being rude, or train being late but everyone understands, if there is a snow storm for example, the tracks will be so snowed down that the train can't pass, it's kind of common sense. And yes people working for you are often rude, i'm used to that and it's not the problem with me at all. Your very system is awful, i cannot book a ticket with rail pass. Customer service is nonexistent too."
332,trustpilot.com,"March 13th from Washington dc to Orlando Florida.  As soon as I got to the door of the train I could smell URINE coming from the inside. The seats are large and there is a good leg room. Attendants do their job as well as they can because there's only a couple of them for the entire trip. The bathroom have small space between toilet and sink, an oversized person can not fit, bathroom floors have URINE,  I'm sure its all over walls also because as a male is using it the train shakes around. People bring in all kinds of food and prepare meals at their seats so the smell of chicken, doritos, tuna takes over the whole car. Prices are comparable to airfare. There was one worker cleaning all bathrooms on all cars. She is an overworked employee and was very pleasant."
333,trustpilot.com,"The Wifi hardly worked at all the entire time I spent traveling. I was hoping to get some work done, or at least enjoy music and TV on my computer, but could not due to the faulty Wifi. Much less likely to travel with Amtrak going forward, as the whole point in choosing a longer but more comfortable travel method is to enjoy the convenience a nd resources, which I was shorted this time around. Airplane Wifi comes at a fee, but at least it works! Amtrak is not a reliable option for those traveling for business and/or trying to be productive during their time traveling."
334,trustpilot.com,Rode 765 on 12/7 at 9:26 to Sta Barbara and returned 12/9 on 4784.  There were four of us traveling.  The crew was so friendly and helpful!  The conductor had an xceptional voice and made each stop fun!  On return trip train was full and we ended up sitting apart.  When the conductor saw this he told us there were four seats together on another cart and took us there.  We were so grateful!! All of the crew was great!
335,trustpilot.com,"Very rude staff onboard train 87 at 3:04 pm. Two staff members scolded me for sitting in coach when I had a coach ticket. Not sure what the problem was, but they were very rude, one even loud, in the ""quiet car."" Need better customer service training!!"
336,trustpilot.com,Food contaminated with possible listeria. Me and my daughter traveled from Florida to nc for a funeral.

Do anyone know who I can file a complaint to?
337,trustpilot.com,"I see lots of criticism here, but I have nothing but praise for this great American experience. I have traveled the world and find taking the train so much relaxing. Yes, at times it feels it takes for ever to reach a destination, but one has the opportunity to enjoy the scenery and, at least in my experience, very nice travel companions. Amtrak personnel I interacted have always been diligent and provided me with good service. It is perhaps about how we approach service providers. Yes, one pay for service, but that does not mean one can expect to be treated with courtesy and respect unless one treats others right. Yes, I consider Amtrak to be an American unpolished gem. And for individuals who complain about Amtrak prices evidently they have been living in a shell. Thank you Amtrak!!"
338,trustpilot.com,"No doubt Amtrak could improve.  But then again, couldn't we all.  That is, many paying passengers do not get, ""It takes 2 to tango"":  What one  puts out is what comes back.  If you're a jerk, jerk is what you'll get in return. What you sew is what you reap. But there are those that believe otherwise. Habitually, they treat others, particularly service folks, like garbage.  Hence, what they see is a garbage world. Try smiling genuinely while asking the Amtrak folks, ""How's your day?"" Guaran ball bearin, It'll change that world within which you roam."
339,trustpilot.com,"I had two sudden deaths in my immediate family back to back. I went on their website to book a last minute train home to be with my family. I found a super cheap fare and immediately booked it because under the circumstances I am strapped for cash. When I went to check out my total almost tripled! I went back redid the process and again the same thing. I restarted my phone and then tried to book on another device! Again, the same exact thing happened. I took screenshots of the fare being displayed and what happens at checkout and then contacted Amtrak for assistance. I was met with the most insensitive, disgusting and extremely rude rep I have ever encountered. He wouldn’t even allow me to explain the situation after being on hold for an entire hour! He then hung up on me without hearing what issues I was experiencing and without helping me at all. I was forced to call back and have been currently on hold for an hour and 15 minutes and counting! Truly sad and disgusting the way that they treat their customers. To act rude and disgusting towards someone that is grieving is unacceptable! True, he may not have know my situation but why should a customer SERVICE agent need to know a person’s personal circumstances in order to show decency and kindness or to provide the necessary support that your customers need?? Truly disappointed!! Although on my end it’s still displaying the cheaper fare, I was told that Amtrak will not honor what I’m seeing as it only matters what they can see. And the only explanation that they could offer me as to why I’m seeing the lower fare is because “the system must be updating” I have several screenshots and have made several attempts to retry it. They offered no type of compassion nor sympathy for what I’ve been enduring on their website! The fare is not the issue, the issue is that its being advertised as a certain amount and of course I’m going to go with the cheaper option but they’re not honoring it which proves they lack integrity!"

343,trustpilot.com,"It's hard to express how rude and dismissive the customer service representative I spoke with today at Amtrak was. It was shocking. Amtrak made an error (twice now) and I asked her to hold for ONE minute while I got the information requested (again) and after waiting an HOUR to speak with them, and when I said I was getting it she just dropped my call and put me back at the beginning of the hold queue. It was unbelievable."
344,trustpilot.com,There was a very young girl in the train with a small dog in a crate.  The dog wasn’t happy and wined occasionally but it really wasn’t that bad.  No one cared.  The Amtrak employee insisted the girl was not abiding by pet rules by not keeping the dog quiet.  He made her get off the train two stops before her stop. She was crying and distraught.  Everyone on the train car booed the employee for his arrogant behavior .
345,trustpilot.com,"After waiting for an hour and a half, who do they think they are Disney, I spoke with a rep about why they’re listing fares  at 20% off for booking early yet the train that I want is full price. No one can answer my question, I have called three times, agents are lazy, short with you and very unhelpful. None of them are super friendly either. They just sound like they’re there because they have to be and they’re definitely working from home because a dog was barking in the background the whole time I was trying to speak with , the agent today. They won’t give me the room for that price either makes no sense. Super frustrating!"
346,trustpilot.com,"Horrible! Never again! I have fallen for this scam 2 times now. Each trip the people are rude and not willing to help, the train is uncomfortable and not the least bit modernized and the conditions are unsanitary. The food is worse quality than store bought dog food. This is just another money laundering scheme for the federal got. I am writing my congressional reps to insist they stop funding this corrupt and poorly run service. Amtrak should go away and let private organizations run and improve our rail systems."
347,trustpilot.com,"We took the Amtrak California Zephyr from Union Station Chicago to Sacramento this summer and it was the most wonderful experience. Yes the train is old but if you go with the right expectations in that respect, you can’t help but be in awe of the journey and the scenery and the service, all of which we’re magnificent. We had a family roomer which was perfect for the four of us. Roman, our room attendant was kind, helpful and funny and made our trip what it was… excellent. The service on the dining car and the food was just what we needed after a transatlantic flight from the UK (special thanks to Dan for getting to know us and what we needed) and the scenery we got to see from our dual aspect windows was breathtaking. Know that you’re not going on a luxury train (because it’s not) and be ok with that, and sit back and enjoy the ride."
348,trustpilot.com,"The video I saw of them kicking two elderly black women off the train because their dog used the bathroom on the train (which was cleaned up immediately) was beyond disgusting.

The trip itself was fine, but the guy (James) running the Cafe Car was extremely rude to my wife for asking if we could order a beer (it was a Sunday morning, so we weren't sure). He treated her like a sack of s**t. We were going on vacation and decided to have a cold one on the trip, if we could. My wife is the nicest person you'd ever want to meet, wasn't the least bit rude, just inquiring. The guy was a complete prik. He's in the wrong business, for sure."

Checked the suitcase before leaving terminal and discovered the theft. Clerks there were unhelpful and unapologetic.  Had to drag information out of them about what to do and who to call. There is NO manager at the Fresno station, just a bunch of clerks who don’t know who their manager is or a phone number to reach them.  I am very angry!!  TRAVELER BEWARE!"

He told her she had to go upstairs. I said she cannot go upstairs and he repeated himself so I repeated myself a little firmer and louder and told him that she is handicapped. And conversation ensued and I had to be firm. He said handicap accommodations cannot be guaranteed. Really! Finally, he said he will work something out. I really had to be firm.

It was so late the Amtrak train behind it was set to pass it. We asked if we could change our ticket to get on that one (a routine thing in developed countries) it would cost us $85 to so. In the process I learned Stamford is the end of the line for the NYC lines. So we'll be using that instead. Amtrak is too unreliable to use for regular use.
360,trustpilot.com,"Our first experience with Amtrak and will be our last. Ticket told us to show up 60 minutes ahead if we had baggage. That's 4:15am, no access to train station.

When these things happen, there's no estimate for how long a fix will take, and in one case the just turned the train around and gave up. The entire process is error prone and wholely unreliable - I would not recommend using Amtrak unless it's your only method of transport."
369,trustpilot.com,"Ride to Boston was great but on the way back one of the employees yelled at us because my kids where eating sour patch kids. Apparently you can't bring food on the train, you can only eat what they sell. So stupid. We had a 5oz opened bag we got the kids from north station and it already just Bout gone when we got on the train. This employee was rude ND un professional.."
370,trustpilot.com,We have traveled Amtrak many times and the service keeps getting worse! Always at least one hour or more late to get on and somehow manages to loose time at our destination! I have renamed the train from Silver Meteor to the Silver Snail!!
371,trustpilot.com,"I'm currently on a train back to Chicago from Flagstaff. Two adults and a baby, it's 4:50 in the morning, and Amtrak overbooked the coach cars of the train. Despite the fact that I bought my tickets WEEKS in advance, my family had to store luggage in the public lounge car, where anyone can just go through our bags and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it. The staff has been as helpful as they can be, but the fact that I have to try and console an exhausted toddler in the viewing lounge car when I PURCHASED TICKETS AND PAID FOR SEATS, is absolutely ridiculous. I tried to save money, but I'll never do this again.Update: it's now 8:53, we are at the Gallup, NM stop, and our train is not moving from the station due to technical errors. This has been a trip from hell, and I just want to go home!"
372,trustpilot.com,On February 8th I was scheduled for the Auto Train. This train was going from Sanford Florida to Lorton Virginia. I drove up the day before I got a hotel room to make sure I arrived on time. 10:00 at night I check my ticket only to find the train is canceled. No notification whatsoever for Amtrak. Got a refund for the train but lost out on the hotel room money. Thanks for nothing AMTRACK.
373,trustpilot.com,"DO NOT,  DO NOT Get on these trains. They are dirty, toilets do not work, , doors do not lock and the nastiest people you will ever met. I paid 2674.00 for 2 tickets to California and back. They dumped us in San Franciso first in dark deserted street full of vacant building, got thru that they then dumped us in Los Angles, cancelled the rest of our trip never telling us that our return trip was cancelled, we were left with NO hotel, NO train, NO contact, No way to get home had to spend another 1000 on plane tickets, lost 4 days of vacation, had a 60 dollar Uber ride to airport and hotel bill for 2 extra nights, promised a refund got Nothing, just headaches They just don't care."
374,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak kicked off two elderly black women on a train they allowed to board when their tiny, elderly puppy accidentally took a poop on board. The ladies were kind and cleaned up, but had the COPS called on them to kick them off in the middle of Colorado.  Absolutely disgusting!!! And during Christmas!  Shame on this company and their staff and all those on board who said nothing as the sad elderly black ladies were escorted off the train.  SHAME!!!"
375,trustpilot.com,Old and dirt seats. Toilets were stinking. No help or assistance to be found when needed. Backward seats awkward!
376,trustpilot.com,Shame on you for kicking off the two elderly black females! You should be embarrassed and I hope we can successfully boycott your company! There is absolutely no justification for the way these ladies were treated and we are still waiting on a response!!

I’m sorry I guess I should be living my life in a mask because people are lazy and can’t Lysol a bathroom down. Have some pride. Step it up Amtrak your always late, you take forever to give your customer any incentives with their rewards if you could they are a frequent traveler. And your lay over in Grand Central Station is way too long. Make some changes your robbing your customers."

379,trustpilot.com,"Our train was supposed to arrive at 3:30, delayed until 3:44. After we boarded we sat down and told us they they'd be closing cars down in DC. The train is packed full of people and you close down cars?! We were forced to go to business class to sit but couldn't stay there. So where would you like us to sit? Great at being consistently terrible."
380,trustpilot.com,"Ride to destination was great! Crew were friendly and polite, the accommodations were comfortable, and travel was smooth. Return trip was on time, unfortunately Conductor K. Williams made a negative first impression with her offensive approach to addressing young passengers. Quick to assert authority when no challenge was posed, family member was simply given incorrect instructions from other crew. Amtrak is great, appreciate their courtesy and care, wish Conductor K. Williams had made a better first impression."

384,trustpilot.com,"I was a frequent rider on Amtrak, loyalty member and loved the service. Now it’s incredibly unreliable. Always late. I’m sitting in a train that was supposed to leave earlier and they are still waiting to switch engines. The rub is when you look at train status, it’s showing the train has already left the station when it hasn’t. Clearly the crew members are frustrated as they don’t exhibit the same customer service. Amtrak fix yourself!"
385,trustpilot.com,I Try using this company’s website is a nightmare. I tried booking a trip online I enter all my information I’m checking to see if I have any rewards it just keeps freezing and freezing and freezing. Very disappointed for such a company do not have a decent Internet connection.I did tried more than once.
386,trustpilot.com,Amtrak  canceled my train and left me stranded in California. Before that we arrived at train stations up to eight hours late. It cost me $257 to fly home and all Amtrak would do was give me a $33 rebate on the two segments of my ticket I didn’t use. Along with $50 for my inconvenience. Of course it’s in the form of an Amtrak voucher that I have to use within a year. typical government run program. I never will take an Amtrak train again!!
387,trustpilot.com,"Booked a roomette on the California Zephyr from Chicago to San Fran through travel agent along with flight from uk, hotels in Chicago and San Fran and Coast Starlight to Seattle with hotel then flight to Canada. Three weeks before flight, Amtrak cancel roomette on Zephyr with no real explanation and no apology. Told we had been given seats in coach class. No time to cancel anything. No apology no compensation no access to restaurant. Cafe food not great, toilets in coach class almost disgusting and Zephyr certainly not the most picturesque train ride in the US( as advertised) . Did get our money back from the difference though but suspect the travel agent had some influence. Coastal Starlight to Seattle in roomette with pleasant staff and really good food. Be careful if booking long haul Amtrak trains they WILL cancel at short notice due to lack of staff as we found out by speaking to people."
388,trustpilot.com,"Train is always late, they lie about the time you travel instead of 3 hours 5 to get to Wisconsin from IL, you guys kidding, staff is rude and people sit apart from each other. If you want to make more money as the company or who ever support this train system - Care about costumers and be on time like you guys never on time and people have lives and places to get to. I do not want to spend my entire vacation on the train. Goodbye."
389,trustpilot.com,"Got late call the train I was suppose to take was canceled due to mud slides, ok with the weather,  it happens. Unacceptable to me was on immediately trying to call customer service,  I have so far spent over 3 hours trying to get thru to them, trying again this morning, but will go down the station this morning to deal with it."
390,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak service workers and train conductors are so ridiculous unfriendly and extremely rude to customers.   They don’t even want to help with heavy bags and when asking for help they said we should do it ourselves.  The trains are always late, the bathroom is filthy and smells."
391,trustpilot.com,"For the ""trains safety"", it had to stop mid trip during a snowstorm,  My daughter and three grandchildren under six years old had to walk 40 minutes in 14° weather through unplowed streets to get to a hotel. Amtrak did nothing for my family."
392,trustpilot.com,"Took California Zephyr from Chicago to Denver and then back to Chicago.  First leg we were 1 1/2 hours delayed.  Trip from Denver to Chicago nearly 3 hours delayed.  Had to ask why was told due to freight traffic no one bothered to tell us anything on why it’s delayed.  I am typing this as we wait.  This is our first experience on traveling by train and it will be our last.  Between the delays and the uncomfortable roomettes, which are not cheap, we won’t ever do this again. Finally got on the train and not one word why it was delayed and not one word why we left Denver nearly an hour later.  Saw a mechanic working on the train and realized there was no freight traffic it was a mechanical issue.  I think there still may be an issue since this train is moving so slow.  Amtrak needs to do better!!!"
393,trustpilot.com,This company is a fraud. I booked a $509 trip back in June 2022 (with the travel protection policy making sure my tickets were refundable should I cancel).Cancelled trip July 2022. We are going into October and I still haven't seen a dime of my money back. The issued me a cash refundable eVoucher but refuse to give me my cash back. The representatives are all RUDE on the phone. Pretend not to hear you when the call. They closed out my online tickets to contact them via email without addressing the issue. Do not travel with this fraudulent company.
394,trustpilot.com,After Amtrak kicked off 2 elderly women in the middle of a once in a generation storm and then strand them with a dog who couldn't help that they needed to potty is beyond the pale. I'm am disgusted to the bottom of my soul. I hope those women and the dog they stranded are ok. Ill never do business with this company nor will any of my friends and family. This will travel far and wide Amtrak. There is nothing they could do or offer to make this right. Disgusting company!
395,trustpilot.com,"We are 4 hours behind schedule, a lot of us have been on this train for a day and night already, (it's hard enough to sleep on a train as it is) we are all exhausted, yet since 7:30 this morning we've had Chatty Cathy every 10  minutes on the intercom telling us ALL  about the sites. Some of us might like it but the rest of us would really like sleep more!! Very rude and inconsiderate since most of us pay a lot of money for these tickets and would like some kind of peace and  Makes no sense to make everybody wear headphones if she's going to be yacking just to hear her own voice. Can somebody please make some sense out of that for me?! I had no idea I would have to put up with this when buying my ticket, or I wouldn't have...I would have paid less money to go Greyhound knowing I was going to get no rest because of rooting and considerate passengers, instead of paying more money, and getting less rest, because of one very very rude and inconsiderate employee who loves the sound of her own voice.REFUND! REFUND!! REFUND!!!"
396,trustpilot.com,Trip from hell.  Over 3 hours late arriving.  I agree with others a bus ride would have been much better.  If you are going to ride the rails go to Europe.   Avoid Amtrak at all costs.
397,trustpilot.com,"First of all our train was 6 hours late, bumping us from a 9:30 PM start to 3:30 AM.  Many people missed their connections.  We rode from Nevada to Chicago (and back 2 weeks later)  The train was dirty.  The bathroom didn't seem to be cleaned for 2 days either direction.  Amtrak is also very slow.  I figure we averaged 40 mph.  In today's world with high-speed trains all over the world there is no excuse for this.  I can understand going slow through mountains, but in the desert and mid-west plains, no excuse not to be traveling at 200 mph.  The infrastructure needs to be changed.  Take money from wars and paying off student debt and put it in to transportation, specifically passenger trains.  The fellow passengers were good for the most part, but it only takes a handful of noisy, rude people to make life miserable.  We had our share of those including a lady doing her Chinese lessons on her phone at 6 AM!  The food in the dining car was only available to sleeper car passengers due to lack of staff.  The food in the snack bar was OK, but expensive.  The staff were mostly kind and helpful."
398,trustpilot.com,"So a few months ago my family and I went on a round trip from Philadelphia to New York City. We had booked business class tickets, yet they don’t let you pick your seats. As a result, the four of us were all separated in the train. This creepy guy came and sat next to me and kind of had his hand outside of his seat area. The seats were big so I was definitely not accidental. We got off after but I feel if we didn’t, he would have groped me. So that is how seriously Amtrak takes the safety of passengers.Another major safety issue: NO SECURITY. Like NONE. No metal detectors, no bag checks. Anyone can just take whatever bombs or weapons they want and no one is stopping them.Yeah so this is basically a nutshell of how Amtrak cares about our safety. Definitely would not suggest Amtrak, especially if you are traveling with young children as like I said, you will all be separated."
399,trustpilot.com,Going from San Diego to Camarillo. The transfer bus is anything but comfortable. Rude employees. Rude drivers. Rude all around. Tickets should be way less for the huge inconvenience  and unprofessional behavior. Staff is awful on the transfer.
400,trustpilot.com,Currently on Train 91 to Tampa.  This is the second time I’ve had the pleasure of having Rodney for my attendant.  He is the best!  The rest of the crew has been top notch also.  I appreciate them.
401,trustpilot.com,The room attendant was great . He took my lunch order 1230 pm but when I got to pick up my lunch I felt like I was in begging line ? The attitude of the server was rude and totally unacceptable . He treated guess like he was the one giving it to us . Very not polite how can Amtrak hire people and allow such lack of courtesy .
402,trustpilot.com,i want to praise one of your employees.david marlowe an amtrak red cap in seattle. i have a disability and he made sure i got on the train safely and helped with my suitcase. he was so helpful and friendly. he is a huge asset to amtrack.
403,trustpilot.com,"A Big Shout Out To Amtrak.🤩 This was my first time riding Amtrak, it was Great Experience. Attendants were friendly, train 🚊 was clean and plenty of space. Thank you Amtrak for getting me safe to New Orleans￼, and safe back home. Thank You God for a safe trip. #amtraktrain❤️🙏🏾"
404,trustpilot.com,I would like to understand how you kicked two elderly black ladies and their dog off your train before their destination!!! This is a disgusting racist act! Amtrak should be ashamed of how these ladies where treated.
405,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak only lists one address as a bus stop in Healdsburg, and put an amtrak sign up on that stop and that stop only. Because of this, I assumed that was the bus stop to wait at. Turns out it wasn't. It was the stop across the street that did not have an amtrak sign on it but had a sonoma county transit sign. I even called amtrak to confirm and they told me the address of the stop I was waiting at is the bus stop, said something else I couldn't fully hear and then hung up abruptly. Anyway, I wound up missing my amtrak bus home because they gave me incorrect information on where to wait at and made things as confusing and frustrating as possible. I was stranded and couldn't make it home because of them, costing me an extra 300 dollars for a hotel. I am disabled and low income. 300 isn't pocket change for me and money that could have gone a long way. Absolutely terrible experience from Amtrak."
406,trustpilot.com,"For the last 36 hours, intermittantly, I have been trying to book a one way ticket from Wilmington, DE to Baltimore Penn Station.   The Amtrak website is terrible.  It sends me in a circle; I put down that I want a 1 way ticket and it reverts back to ""round trip"", the computer generated assistant comes on and then redirects you somewhere else.  The site offers a $15.00 ticket but once you get re-routed, you may wind up paying $55.00 for a ticket.  With all the money we pay for Rail fare, you would think they had enough money to pay a knowledgeable website designer to come up with something that works.  As it is now, Amtrak may as well be functioning as it did in 1822; I still have to go to the ornery desk clerk to purchase a ticket to ride."
407,trustpilot.com,"Our train was delayed and we missed our following train (both on the same ticket). The next proposed train was after 7 hours. For a 7 hours journey, the total journey would have been 14 hours. We asked staff on train about the policy, they were nice but incompetent in matters related to delay. Ground staff the same. Only option was to call Amtrak. We wasted 1h45 minutes on wait on the call, but no reply. We decided to take a taxi and pay 200$. Amtrak didn't refund our taxi fare where ground staff had told us it could be possible that we would be refunded. Please allow a lot of extra time if you want to use Amtrak service."
408,trustpilot.com,"Folks, Amtrack sucks. While there is no traffic like when you are traveling in a car, the company can't organize timely arrival and departure. Delays, engine problems, café problems...If you must use Amtrack, there is a big chance you will be late like we are on our flight from Newark Airport.Keep it in mind!"
409,trustpilot.com,"The worst experience I’ve ever had in my life. Not only did there food made me sick no one checked on us to see if we needed medical attention no conductor nothing, but the train was  8hours late to my destination after it was suppose to be a 17 train ride turned out to be 22 hours . They did not say or explained why the train was late. They only offer microwaveable burgers and microwaveable Mac and cheese. Warning Do not eat that is what made me sick. Then when the train finally arrived 8hours late they had us wait inside the train cart for 1hour without air conditioning food or water. To make a long story short DONT ever ride Amtrak they will take your money you will be late yo your destination and they will not reimburse you for your money. Save yourself the aggravation and just fly or drive.Go somewhere else they only want your money."
410,trustpilot.com,"amtrak is awful. why the us has such a horrible train system  is a mystery but it is the worst. Late, rude,dirty. we were stuck outside of chicago for a couple of hours because of other trains or at least that was the excuse  given.  the train was late into st louis as well"
411,trustpilot.com,Amtrak is a great way to get places. Have to give 5 stars to Sheri and Ed. They had to deal with people that thought they could choose to sit where they wanted to and have other move that had been on the train for a while already. Sheri and Ed you both dealt with it very professionally. I've ridden the Amtak many times and staff has always been friendly and well mannered.
412,trustpilot.com,"You know, any company seems fine when nothing goes wrong; you see what a company really is when you have to contact hem with an issue.  I've been on the phone for over 1 1/2 hours so far talked to one person who was just an overflow and could not do anything, and was hung up on Twice before I could even tell them what my issue was...    The issue; their web site somehow switched my return date to a different  day when booking my ticket.  The web site only has bots that  are useless, the help line has way to small  of a useful window for a company that  goes from coast to coast (their phone support is about the same as the 6 branch one county bank I worked  at), and they are set up to waste your time so that by the time you get a refund it will cost you more in time than the value of what ever money you could get back from them."
413,trustpilot.com,"We paid over $400 for return travel from Boston to New York. Outward trip was fine. Returning from New York the train was over 3 hours late, no explanation or assistance we all had to sit on the station floor. When it did arrive there were too many people for the train, and we were forced to give a guard $50 cash to get us on the train, that we had paid so much for. The train was so late we missed our onward trip and dinner with family. I complained about the whole experience and their staff demanding cash at the station, I've had no reply at all to my e-mails which were now 2 weeks ago. I asked for a refund and a explanation why their staff were allowed to demand cash, and if they knew that was happening Awful company and customer service. made the British Rail system seem efficient !"
414,trustpilot.com,Amtrak sold me and my mother a ticket when we got to the station to depart for our trip they cancelled  and said no more trips we're going out this week How can they take our money? We had to $150 more to ride the bus any order to get to our destination Been up since 4:3am it's 5.22 and we are just leaving
415,trustpilot.com,"I don't know where to begin, for starters the website didn't work properly and when I called them they had raised the price by $50 dollars, but this was only the beginning of my descent into hell. If you thought the people at the DMV were bad wait until you meet the Amtrak staff—the station attendant seemed to want to inject the very air around him with misery, curt, rude and hating life. The rest of the staff seemed to strive to be as arrogant, condescending and put upon as humanly possible (my God your a glorified usher don't treat people like chattle). Not to pile on but the car stinks, looks and feels dirty, not just dirty unsanitary, in has all the charm of a downtown bus stop replete with people sleeping on the floor. Terrible. What a simply terrible experience. Don't give them money. And if you do have to take this purgatory on wheels make sure to bring your own food, $7.50 for a microwaved cheese burger, and they expect—I mean it they expect you to tip. Please avoid, public transportation in this country needs an overhaul."
416,trustpilot.com,"This was my first time using Amtrak, and it was a horrible experience with their customer service department! I waited for 45 minutes to talk to someone to have my trip canceled, and the woman was curt with me and refused to give me a full refund. I was given only $48 and a voucher out of the $140 that I spent. I was also charged $16. Absolutely ridiculous."
417,trustpilot.com,"Arrived in San Francisco following a great stay on the California Zephyr however, arrival in Emeryville was chaotic, especially trying to get our bags out of the hold, and the very unhelpful coach attendant. On arrival in SF we were dumped in the middle of nowhere, in a dark poorly lit  neighbourhood with no way to get to our hotels as we were too far from the main tourist drag with no taxis/buses around. As everyone drifted away we were left on our own with a dangerous aggressive man near us & it was terrifying - I was in tears. We only made it safely to our hotel thanks to a couple from the train we bumped into who were in the same situation but had eventually managed to get a taxi & their driver called us another cab - even he was worried about leaving us standing there in the dark. This needs to change urgently for people's safety."
418,trustpilot.com,"I was so excited to take the train from Vancouver to Seattle when I noticed it was working again.The experience was terrible from the beginning till the end. The train conductor & immigration officers were extremely rude, talking to us like some lower class, evidently looking down on us and thinking we were stupid. I don't see why I should put up with that attitude after paying $200 for the trip. We are your clients who pay for your salary, so please re-adjust how you're talking to us!To top it all, we ended up in Bellingham because of some issues on the railway & were told that we could either go back to Vancouver (After 2hrs on the train? Thank you very much!), or find our own means of transport. Which I did, it's just that it cost me another US$100, and I still wait to see my refund from Amtrak! Not speaking of that I purposefully chose to travel by train to enjoy the train ride; if I knew I would have to take a bus, I would have never gone. So next time - no thank you."
419,trustpilot.com,The worst trip ever. Missed our train home due to being in a blizzard & no way to get to train asked to reschedule & was told we had to forfeit our ticket & puchase a new one. We only paid 300.00 for round trip & was charged 452.00 for just one way to get home. Toilets were overflowing on the train & it was filthy dirty. Both stations were unmanned & doors were locked were left out in the cold to wait. Terrible customer relations. They offered a voucher but not a refund. I would NEVER ride on another Amtrak train even if I was paid so why would I want a voucher.

THE TWO BUNK PRIVATE ROOM WAS A CLOSET WITH THE TOP BUNK NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO, CERTAINLY NOT FOR SENIORS. A DESASTOR OF A TRIP, NEVER TO DO AGAIN."
421,trustpilot.com,"Worst experience ever. Booked a room on way down to Sanford for extra $. It was so small, like a cracker box but was the best they had. Ac didn't work as they override it and we froze all night. Then you have to walk multiple cars to get to dinner. Food was good but hallways are tight and leak water on you when rain happens. Bathroom was impossibly small and tough to get into at an angle. And we were supposed to shower when sitting on commode? On way back we arrived at 1:30 to find out they gave away our roomette and moved us 4 train cars back. We asked why and they said we do this all the time to accommodate families. We had a reservation for a specific room and car!!! We can't go to dinner as it's too far for my knee to handle( due for replacement). Any hope of a good experience is completely gone. Amtrak operations are subpar and we will NEVER do this again- I could have been a great passenger multiple trips but the travel option of train will never be selected again. So be warned this is not great!"

423,trustpilot.com,"A continuation of my previous review. The City of New Orleans ran out of coffee at 11am this morning, most food choices were missing as well. I expected that Amtrak would have a dining car but they eliminated the car. When I get home I will be contacting my congressional representatives and request funding for this unimaginably mismanaged company be eliminated. I am disgusted that my tax dollars are currently funding this transit nightmare."

Those women could have died because of your actions and because so, that is considered attempted muder....I hope those women sue the flying hell out of this company and ANY OTHER COMPANY THAT DOES THIS MESS!!! To the police officers who were called for this, you know right from wrong. What ever department hired you needs to fire you."

426,trustpilot.com,That video of them calling the police to kick 2 elderly black ladies off the train bc their dog pooped and they cleaned up after their dog…. Is so disgusting. Left these 2 ladies and their dog stranded on the side of the road on Christmas Eve!??? Amtrak should be filled with absolute shame. Why allow dogs on the train then? Will never use you and will tell everyone I know to avoid Amtrak bc they are RACIST. Either against old black ladies or little dogs.
427,trustpilot.com,"Train cancelled & stranded in Chicago with no other train options 3/25. Had to stay an extra night in the hotel and rent a car to drive back 8 hours 3/26. We spent over $600 to get home when our train tickets were $120 total. We could have flown back home with tickets easily under $150 each if we booked when we initially scheduled the trip. We chose to take the train back home to enhance our journey and have a relaxing journey home. This turned into a nightmare when Amtrak cancelled 3 hours before departure, all other train options were booked or cancelled, all flights were either booked or $500 per ticket and no car rentals were available until the next day. The relaxing train journey turned into an extra $600 expense with 8 hours of driving. Amtrak was not able to provide any assistance during the day the train was cancelled. Tickets were refunded and told to call Monday when Customer Service is open. Called Monday & waited on hold for over an hour. Customer service offered $100 voucher for use within 1 year & directed me to contact corporate via email for a response in 6-8 weeks. Customer rep advised that they do not have a supervisor when asked to speak with someone above them. Rep advised that only method for going forward is contacting corporate. I no longer feel comfortable traveling with Amtrak in the future now that I know the customer service response. Amtrak will do nothing or will not provide any assistance if you are stranded. They do not care. Would leave a 0/5 stars if possible."

429,trustpilot.com,"I am disappointed in my Amtrak train experience. I’d been looking forward to my first overnight train experience for months. The views over the Rockies on the California Zephyr were great! But if you need to sleep, you don’t want to be on this train. It is rare for me to get motion sickness but sleeping on the top bunk on the top level of the sleeper car made me feel like I had been shaken violently for hours. And the loudness of the train whistle (which blew all night long through Nebraska) was way too close to the sleeper cars. If you need to get to your destination anywhere close to on-time, especially to make a connection, you don’t want to be on this train. Our train ride back home started 2 hrs late, (which we received no notification of) and we arrived back in Chicago four hours late. Our train ride there was 1.5 hours late. If you are trying to save money by taking the train, think again and don’t take this train. Even making our reservations 4 months ahead of time, pricing is so expensive for what you get. The bathrooms were not kept clean. By the second day, the trash bins were overflowing. On the upside, the staff was friendly and helpful. The conductors’ commentary was often delightful. The other passengers were fun to get to know. The food was OK. Bottom line - This was our first and will be our last trip on Amtrak."
430,trustpilot.com,If I could give your evil ass company a zero I would.  Your evil company put 2 elderly black woman off in the middle of nowhere in the damn cold because of a little dog's poop.  You all some wicked mother f**kers if those ladies were related to me in any way I would sue you for all you got.  I pray they do.  And don't worry we all boycotting your ass.
431,trustpilot.com,"This was our first and last time riding Amtrak. The first leg of our trip was great. The ride, service and views were amazing. On our return trip from Salt Lake City we received notification 36 hours prior to departure that our train was delayed due to weather. Completely understandable with mountain snows. I continued to check the train status on the Amtrak app every few hours. At 4:00am and again at 6:20am on the day of departure I spoke with customer service and was told that the train was still delayed and would not arrive until at least 5:00pm. At 7:10am I again checked the status to see if it was delayed or service disrupted as it had gone back and forth between these two things. It said our train was in SLC and departing in less than 30 minutes. I called customer service in the way to the station and they confirmed (after 20 minutes) that yes we were supposed to be on that train. Arrived at the station but was denied boarding because the train was already closed. Tried to explain the situation but got no where. The train sat there for another 20 minutes before leaving. Shame on Amtrak for such awful communication and shame on the station staff for such lack of compassion when it was there fault!! It’s sad that this happened because had our return trip been like of one going to SLC Amtrak would have gotten 5 stars"

435,trustpilot.com,"Horrible experience today. I had purchased a round trip from BWI to Newark and paid a premium as I guess it is Spring break. They did not scan my ticket on the way up. I didn’t think anything of it- the conductor just seemed busy and disorganized. When I got in my seat for the return trip, someone else said it was their seat and their ticket showed the same seat as me. When the conductor scanned it, he said mine was cancelled as there was no record of me doing the first leg of the trip. The return ticket was still showing in my app, no one contacted me to ask if I had done the first leg or even to tell me they had cancelled the return ticket (who just arbitrarily cancels a ticket someone has paid for) so I had no idea before getting on the train. When I explained the situation to the conductor and said it was cancelled in error- he got annoyed at me and said rudely  - “you need to move as you are in HIS seat” referring to the other passenger. I actually had to tell him to remain nice as this was not my fault and I am being moved from MY seat due to their error. I then had to spend an hour standing up in the cafe car calling the 1800 number (that is how long their wait was) to get them to allocate me a new seat- which they did. My train was the 6.15 from Newark  (2169) to Washington DC and it was a male conductor speaking to me this way- if Amtrak reads this, I really hope you speak to him and remind him to be courteous to your customers. Also, please do not just cancel tickets without clarifying a situation or speaking to a customer."
436,trustpilot.com,"This is the worst experience that I’ve had with Amtrak. I will never use them again. First I booked a trip from St. Paul to Chicago, at 1:00am I was notified that the train will be 3hrs delayed which will arrive at 10:30am. When I got to the station at 9:30am I was told that the train will be delayed until after 3:00pm. I’m so upset that I had to spend money for a Uber there and back home and I live 40mins away from the station. You should’ve just cancel the damn train ride for the damn day. And because of Amtrak I missed visiting my father in the hospital."

438,trustpilot.com,"First, I am unable to enter the correct date here--September, 2022.We thought we would try a new adventure--no plane this time.  VERY bad decision.  Late train leg by hours; poor, insensitive communication about helping with luggage and distances from hotels to train or bus depots;  multiple stops of bus legs to the point of being unbearable; incredibly poor communication about a cancelled leg because of strike that created a very stressful situation while on one leg-+no help to alleviate the stress by making other arrangements or even offering to get us home or whatever--nothing; we had to make shuttle arrangements, hotel reservations, and plane flight arrangements to get back on track; unguarded luggage at the exits of the train, no monitoring of who is taking luggage--whether it is theirs or not, lies about bed sizes; poor communication about which stop is our stop--could have been taken further without us knowing, no personal touch; allowing suspect people with mental health and personal hygiene issues on the  train with healthy, sane folks, rude personnel, including bus drivers on carryover legs; being forced to sit with people that we did not know at a table for dinner because the waiters did not want multiple tables being used--we could NOT sit alone and have a quiet, private meal--UNBELIEVABLE!!!   We wouldn't get monetary satisfaction without being forced to buy travel insurance about their foul-ups.  It took over three months to get some remuneration due to the debacle.  Again difficult, insensitive communication.   And this company is a federally owned??!!   We could go on!!!"

441,trustpilot.com,"Never got a lunch, no complimentary water, the staff were rude and make minimal effort and acted like the passengers are an inconvenience and a chore. They didn't try to make a pleasant environment at all or offer good service especially with roomettes where you're paying a lot of money. Sorry but isn't it your job as an attendant to see to the needs of your passengers? Lots of miscommunication and no organization. I don't think I will take it again.Recommendations from a first time passenger: if you announce breakfast is first come first serve and there's.plenty of open tables for you to choose from, then don't act like the passenger and came in and sat down at an open table is carrying a bomb. If the rules are you have to wait at the doorway regardless.of.reservation or first come first serve then clearly state that. Or better, put a sign in front of the entry door to remind people. But freaking out and yelling is unprofessional and uncalled for.A small pamphlet of good to know FAQs would be good to put in each room. Such as what to call your attendant using the light for. Sleeper passengers are told their attendant will come by around meal times to take orders and see if you want it delivered to the room or make a reservation. Ether they do that or the passenger has to call them to their room. Which one is it?? Showing the schedules of when things are open are nice too such as cafe times and if the sight seer lounge has closing times."

443,trustpilot.com,I payed shy of $500 for traveling on Amtrak from Reno Nevada to Chicago Illinois . I went to the bathroom on the Amtrak after noticing bug bites on my arm and crazy itching all over. When I lifted my clothing… I saw a bunch of bright red bed bug bites. I just couldn’t handle the itching. I reported to driver and another worker. I showed them bites and some photos I took in the bathroom of bites. One of the workers took my name and number. The driver said to contact Amtrak and that they would reimburse me and that they were sorry. I’ve been trying to reach a supervisor by phone and email and nobody is responding. My husband had to drive to the small town of Osceola Iowa to get me. I just wanted to shower and get out of what I was wearing. I had to get off the train and didn’t even go to Chicago anymore. I was supposed to spend the weekend in Chicago with my husband and instead we went stair home after being picked up. I’ve showered like 4 times since yesterday morning and I’m still itchy. I tried applying ointments and it’s not helping.
444,trustpilot.com,"I have round trip tickets from Fresno to San Juan Capistrano. From Fresno to SJC was great. Every staff member was wonderful.I got to LA for my return and was in a long line to board my bus to get over the grapevine.A few of us got up to the front of the line and were told ""This bus is full, you need to get on ""that"" bus (points to a bus with a forming line.) Instead of having the last 4 of us get to the break of the second line, he walks off, leaving us to now get in a second long line to get on the bus. No courtesy at all. He did not say what bus was what,  nothing useful. So in line we go. I get up to the front, people are moving fairly well, so good, but I missed the area to place my bag. The same staff member, customer service, I found out, was sitting down watching us, not helping with bags to make more room o. The edges. I put mine in the space, I slipped it under a portable barrier because otherwise I would have had to lift it over a concrete bench. This customer service rep got angry and said something unintelligible- while sitting. I said ""I don't want to have to get out of another long line, sorry"" He became very confrontational and said ""Did you say something?"" I repeated my statement, and he said ""Next time I say to put your luggage around the barrier, for safety, do it, or you won't get on my bus.""I gave him a thumbs up. Such horrible service from one man who basically sat on his butt the whole time. I am trying to feel sad for him, he must be miserable. But I am a paying customer and he should have been trained for his position to be helpful and courteous. Or go dig ditches."

446,trustpilot.com,"I am a very disappointed and dissatisfied customer. I ride Amtrak twice a week, every week. There are several times when the train is late, and I miss my ride to my destination and many times miss my connecting train, to my destination. Today I was 2 late because there was an accident on Route 66 in VA which is my route to catch Silver line, which is my first train to union station in Washington DC. Unfortunately I had to arrive at union Station in Washington DC 2 minutes to my train departure time. My was 138 and departure time was 6:05, I arrived 6:03 and was told I can’t go because the doors are closed. I was referred to the ticket department, met the first customer service woman, who told me I will have to pay a huge amount for the difference with the next train. I asked if there is anything she can do, she asked me to wait for the supervisor. She clearly told me with a tight voice that she cannot do anything for me. Now I have been charged an additional fee of $108.00 with no remorse from the supervisor.  she told me there nothing she can do and I will have to pay $108.00 for a later train or refund my money. I cannot believe what she said, I think she thinks I am just riding the train for fun. I told her I can’t cancel my trip because I have to be at work. Even when I told her I am a frequent rider and there had been times when the train is late and ended up missing my connecting train or ride, all she said was, I should have called for compensation which, just like not knowing that the doors closed 2 minutes to departure time, I don’t know I should call any time my train is delayed. I called customer relations and stayed on the phone for over an hour. I had to hang up and write this review. This is very heart rendering. The customer service is too poor. They act like they are God, they posses too much power and talk to customer in a very rude manner. I am writing for customer relations to look into my issue and refund me the $108.00 that I have been charged. I hope this issue would be looked at seriously. Thank you"

448,trustpilot.com,"DO NOT GO ON AMTRAK!!! Worst travel experience ever!!! Always delayed, ALWAYS!!! Literally the worst line EVER!"
449,trustpilot.com,"I decided it would be a good idea to travel via Amtrak from  Hattiesburg, Mississippi to Union Station/Washington, DC and then home to Maryland. The beginning part of the trip was saddened by the death of my eldest sister's husband, us going home to Mississippi Gulf Coast for his funeral.  We had already shipped his body, and wanted to just be around my eldest sister and each other. My son and another sister decided to do the same.  For my son, it would be his first memory of riding in a train. They each received different messages from Amtrak and missed their train.   So they did not travel until Thursday, April 20th.  Their trip was delayed by 4 hours and their experience was so horrible that my son — said, no thanks back to flying. ONE and DONE! The rudeness of the employees was horrible under the circumstances. (Unfortunately, a teenage kid tried to beat the train. My condolences to his family.) My son was on the phone with me and I could hear someone being SO RUDE, I was shocked to learn it was an Amtrak employee speaking like that. She was VERY nasty to the riders, At least she was non discriminatory, as she raised her voice at all of them.  I shocked by what I was over hearing.  I wished I had thought to record her too. Next day, I was enroute and got caught by a CSX train. When I called Amtrak I was informed they were behind schedule, NOT TRUE. I missed my  train on Friday, April 21st. (Unfortunately , I had already turned my rental car in, I was lucky they dropped me off at the train station.) On Saturday, April 22nd, I arrived early and waited for the train. It was my first time paying to ride in the sleeper cars/a Roomette.  I tried to ask the Amtrak employee who came off the train and was standing by the door/gate where I should stand, WOW!(I was trying to ask where should I go for the sleeping cars…get in her line or do I go somewhere else.) The VERY RUDE employee threw her hand up at me, in the motion of shut up, and I did. The hand motion was clear to me and others that I was to shut up, so I did).  (I had two witnesses, the relative and new friend helping me with my luggage.) Well, after saying all aboard, I was like wait!!! The Rude Amtrak employee said she did not know I needed to ask a question or that I was riding the train.  It was a customer that told me where to go to board the sleeper car. Unfortunately, the same RUDE employee, appeared at the sleeper car.  She said I was not listed as a passenger on the train, and therefore I could not board .  No matter what I said, she held firm.I was pretty much begging her to check and insisting that I was on that train.  I checked my email, didn’t see the update but I was verbally inform by an Amtrak employee that my train would have the information.  The RUDE employee told me that I could not ride and pulled up the steps. I just felt so overwhelmed from my BIL's death, missing the train and then not getting on the train. If not for my cousin, I know I would have broken down. On Sunday, April 23, 2023, I was back at the station a 3rd time.  The conductor informed me that my name is very familiar.  I told her you may have seen it listed, since this is my 3rd attempt to ride this train home.I decided to contact Amtrak CS, and file a complaint when I arrived home.  Guess What!  CS also saw my name listed for each day that I was supposed to be on the train.  Both CS and the Conductor referenced my being on the train on Saturday, 22 April.  BTW:  My train was also late arriving into Union Station, we were delayed. On top of everything else. SMH.I waited, but never heard from Amtrak. I filed a complaint with the BBB, again no response.  As of today, Amtrak never responded to the complaint I filed with the BBB in April complaint. I guess their thought is what's one customer even if she did pay for a sleeper care and missed train fees.Amtrak is in the process of starting a passenger train on the Mississippi Gulf Coast (no more Hattiesburg for the Coast people) which would travel directly through my hometown area.  I have been monitoring their progress and so looking forward to Amtrak coming to the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  I may just do like my son, and other Sibs who live outside the Coast said they would be doing.  FLY.  If I change my mind, and do ride Amtrak (Golden rule of the 21st century, a fully charged phone and record/video).I don’t know, what to suggest except to say don’t fire the person, have the person go through customer service training. Honestly, I was really surprised that Amtrak did not respond to my complaint with the BBB.  I am out of suggestions.  Oh well, lesson learned and duly noted."

I attempted to do it online, but the website doesn't let you change locations, just date/time.  So i called and waited for 15 minutes to get a person.  I got halfway through the conversation with her, and all of a sudden I was punted to their auto-survey.  So this time I decided to just cancel my trip online, take the penalty and create a new reservation.  I created my new reservation and right as I completed adding in all of the information including the passenger info and credit card information, it told me that my train was sold out.  Why wouldn't it show me that when I was choosing the itinerary??!  So I ended up trying to call again.  Waited for a person and finally got someone.  This time the representative told me that she's having some audio issues on her end and could I please hold.  She came back 5 minutes later and we resumed.  She then interrupted and said she was still having issues, but we decided to press on.  I asked her if there was ANY room on the train that I wanted to get on that was sold out.  She told me that there was a room available but it was $683.  I asked if I could use points and she said ""Oh.  You have to talk to Guest Rewards if you want to use points.  She transferred me, but now I've been on hold for over 30 minutes and still waiting.  Why don't they show all rooms on all trains online?  And if there's a special guest rewards section, why isn't THAT on their website as well?!?!  Stay far far away if you have ANY other alternatives."

459,trustpilot.com,"Well, Amtrak just provided me with an experience so bad I will NEVER take the train again. I was supposed to leave Chicago headed to Detroit at 5:50pm last night. I got to the station at 4 to be sure I wasn’t late. I was told at 5 that the train was running a few minutes late. Then at 5:50 we were told it would be there at 7. Seven came and went and they changed the arrival time to 9. Just after 9 we were told that the train was broken down states away and they had no way to get us home. We were stuck in the lobby trying to figure out how to get home. They were less than helpful. I asked if we could get on the next train and the guy said “maybe, go check at the ticket counter.” Then we asked if there might be buses we could take, and his response was “it’s 3 blocks away, walk there and see.” So I was left with having my husband who just worked a 16 hour shift driving 8 hours round trip to get me, and I was worried sick he would fall asleep at the wheel. Eventually they “found parts and put together” a train. So my husband drove 2 hours at 11pm for nothing, and we wasted 5 hours sitting there. We ended up back to Detroit at 4:45 am. I got home at 5:30, and now I get to take care of my sick child and go to work when I don’t even feel safe to function. This ruined yesterday and today for me, I will never use Amtrak again, and I will let everyone who may be thinking of taking the train know just how bad my experience was."
460,trustpilot.com,"We planned an Amtrak vacation over a year in advance for a once in a lifetime experience to travel from Houston up through Chicago and to Boston to see the fall leaves changing colors. I have wanted to do this most of my adult life. My husband set up my first train ride ever to celebrate my birthday, and for what we hoped would be a truly memorable experience. It was, but for all the wrong reasons. We worked with Amtrak vacation planners and spent a fortune for what was sold to us as a first class experiences on Amtrak's sleeper bedrooms with dining cars and a chef to serve us in our bedroom or in the dining car. First thing, we spent 4 hours on a gross, cramped, dirty bus from Houston to Longview to get on the #22 train to Chicago. Then we spent 4.5 hours waiting on hard benches while the train was late. The Amtrak person actually said ""it's late and sometimes they don't even show up, so be prepared."" The service and food on Amtrak were horrid. We wandered around trying to find food every mealtime and the employees were all sitting on their phones yacking with each other. They acted like we didn't exist. Nobody pays any attention to the customers, and if they do, it's like you're an inconvenience. The ""first class"" food is boxed, unrecognizable grossness that has been microwaved to the point that you can't even get it off the plastic plate with the plastic knife. Even airline food is significantly better than the garbage they serve on Amtrak. We both rated it F-; it was that bad, and I mean every meal. The only thing worth asking for is something like yogurt or a soda in a can, which will be warm. Our bedroom #D was disgustingly unclean. There were leftover water bottles and pills on the floor from a previous guest. One bath towel was even covered with mold. The saving grace is the timing of the scenery and catching the fall leaves turning colors. That part is glorious. Sadly, the windows on every bit of the train and all the cars are so dirty that it's hard to see the scenery details through them. I'm writing this after the first segment Houston to Chicago, and so far can't recommend Amtrak to my worst enemy, much less someone I care about. If you're looking to spend hard earned vacation money for a first class experience, don't chose Amtrak."

466,trustpilot.com,"This winter my husband and I decided to visit my family for Christmas. We live in Oregon and they live in Montana. Going into the winter season we knew it would not be safe to drive for the visit because of the mountain passes between here and our destination. At first, we looked at plane tickets and were quickly overwhelmed buy the prices and travel times. We decided to try something different and take the train. At first, all seemed well. We arranged to take the train from Pasco, WA to Whitefish, MT and my father would drive 3 hours to pick us up. Everything was in order.To spare everyone the long story of our travel experience, here are some numbers: 2 cancellations, 13 hours of delays for a distance that can be traveled by car in 6.5 hours, 2 people in the wrong rooms, 5 laps walked on and around the train to find an employee, 29 hours of travel time with 3 hours of sleep, 2.5 hours of the train moving,  2 announcements about travel vs 4 announcements about the dining car, and 11 hours spent sitting in train stations. I do not fault Amtrak for the delays and cancellations. The winter storm with multiple feet of snow and temperatures in some locations reaching 50 below zero was out of their control. However, the lack of communication during the troubleshooting process prevented the passengers from having the opportunity to make informed decisions about their travel plans and potentially make other arrangements was frustrating and could have easily been resolved. My second annoyance with Amtrak is the lack of support when a train is cancelled. Yes, they do offer free rescheduling and a refund for cancellation, but not everyone has the luxury of having a flexible work schedule and accommodating family/friends that can allow them to leave a different day than originally planned or even worse, get back home. I can see how many people, if they landed in the same cancelled train situations that I found myself in, could have trouble getting back home and get to their jobs. In these situations, alternate travel accommodations should be provided. My last complaint is the lack of available staff on the train. When passengers had concerns and questions, it was difficult to find staff to help. All passengers were left unattended and allowed to wander while everyone's luggage sat out. Passengers could climb onto the train and in whatever room or seat without supervision to prevent them from taking someone else's spot. Unfortunately, I do not see myself considering taking Amtrak again and will not be recommending it to those I know. The only people I can recommend it to would be to people who have no schedule to keep, no valuables to protect, and no qualms with uncomfortable train station seating."

472,trustpilot.com,"My recent Amtrak trip.This experience could be improved by avoiding Amtrak all together. My experience was planned as a bucket list type event. I spent a lot of money for sleeper car travel. Wifi access was advertised. I rode 4 different trains. There is no Wifi. Corporate Amtrak's lack of corporate awareness for truthfulness and customer service needs is the problem. They simply don't seem to give a flying Frito about even minimal service.The initial roomette trip was uneventful, aside from the gross smell, cramped accommodations and dire need of modernization.  There was one electrical outlet. The bathrooms often made my skin crawl. I was later to learn that coach had more access to more reliable outlets than the expensive cramped roomette. The attendant was great and the t.v. dinner was ok.The nightmare came on the return trip. I had booked this trip 2.5 months in advance. I booked a sleeper roomette  from Pittsburgh to Chicago. Two days after purchasing tickets, the roomette went out of commission. I was not notified. The change was ignored and my reservation stayed the same for 2.5 months - while the remaining rooms were filled. On the morning of my departure ""operations"" fixed things. When I arrived at the Pittsburgh station the attendant rudely barked that I was riding coach to Cleveland. She told me I booked it that way and if I had a problem - talk to the ticket clerk. Fat lot of good that did. He told me there were no other accommodations and that I just didn't know how to book reservations...next time get help from someone who knew the job. I was deeply insulted. Condescension did not improve matters. I assumed that double booking had occurred. It had not. Amtrak just didn't bother to address the problem till the last minute. As a result I was bumped into Coach from Pittsburgh to Cleveland and made to believe it was my problem.  At 3:00 a.m.,on a cold winter morning, I had to gather my belongings and walk to another car in which a sleeper emptied out. The one outlet in the room was so loose that I could not use my cpap. Arrival in Chicago was a relief. My only complaint with the metropolitan lounge in Chicago were the female drill sergeants at the reception desk. Manners always help. Those gals missed that class. I did not appreciate the repeated screamed reminders to display my green pass.After a 6 hour layover, I boarded my final train. By this time I was so exhausted and short of breath. My inhalers didn't help much. I rarely had the opportunity to remove my mask. There is no accommodation for Covid and my risk is significant....so a sleeper car was important at night.  When I arrived at my final destination 5 hours later, the attendant forgot to unload my cpap. I was absolutely exhausted. My insurance company will not replace this recent replacement. I face significant health issues as a direct result of Amtrak's ""service"". I have nothing but good things to say about the attendant. He could not have been more accommodating and helpful. He is not responsible for a broken system. Amtrak's deliberately negligent regard for passenger belongings assured that my cpap would be lost without constant vigilance. Unfortunately, Amtrak has no system for tracking carry on luggage that is stored in the entryway storage areas.  My only hope is the fact that I did label my baggage. In my opinion, today's Amtrak travel is abominable. I am writing this the day after return. I have spent 2 hours , at least, on the phone with customer relations. The little compensation that was offered was insulting. I have little hope of my item being returned. My guess is that it is already up for sale on craigslist."

I always hated the company even when I used to ride with them , many horrible experiences, I wanted to be a part of making this company better but this is just confirmation on how messed up in the head this company truly is and BEWARE OF THEIR LIES AMTRAK DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONE LITERALLY"
474,trustpilot.com,First off I would like to say my experience on train 20 is horrible the conductor is unprofessional the staff seem like they do not know what they are doing and on top of that it rained inside the Train the whole trip from Charlotte to BWI I believe if the conductor was not trying to sleep with the female staff he will be a good employee at Amtrak
475,trustpilot.com,Train that cannot keep to promised scheduled is not a train at all.
476,trustpilot.com,"I called customer service and just because I had an accent he kept on laughing and that is so unprofessional of him,,,he kept on telling me to spell the name so that he could laugh and that pissed me off, if I could tell him to speak in my language he will also have an accent so I just don’t understand what was funny, I think you should teach your staff to be professional."

478,trustpilot.com,"… Mind you I haven’t taken a trip with Amtrack in about 16 years my mom probably 10 years…Back then we had viewing cars and the trains were clean the food was great. It Was a wonderful experience! We had fresh cooked food with the chefs that cooked our meals, There was waitresses and waiters…we had real silverware glasses etc. it felt just like a Restaurant on wheels ..fancy though! The rooms were very clean the windows on the trains were clean it looks like the advertisement they show now! 😳However mom and I decided to take a train trip to Chicago because we remember how enjoyable it was back then. After getting on the train we had a room with a restroom inside Which was not to clean and sleeping on the top bunk I smelt the exhaust from the engine which was not good. They definitely need to do some updates on the train and fixings… When getting ready to have our meals we were pretty excited,come to find out there is like five things on the menu for lunch and dinner and when you get them it is worse than a TV dinner… I don’t know who came up with this menu but the food is horrible it comes in a tin tray and It is placed on the table so when you come to eat there it is… The service that we had in the dinner car was not good at allthe people had attitudes the train conductors servers workers etc. took 4 tables nobody could eat at, I guess was their break area they did announce when they were on break… When asking to get a mixed drink we were told that you had to pay for them… When you get a room you are allowed to have one mix drink per person in that room for your dinner I actually had to show the lady what was said in the articles in order to get one… Also there is unlimited drinks however the lady who took care of the cash register and the café had an attitude and said you only get one I had to again show her my advertisement of Amtrack again and she got an attitude and said she’s gonna be talking to somebody about that! I did get sodas however… I’m sure these people are a little shorthanded but when they give attitude and mouth off at the customers and don’t clean up on the tables it definitely does not want me to come back… The food again was not good at all we finally bought a hotdog from the menu. sad thing is that was delicious compared to what we get for having a room!  …That hotdog was the best hotdog after eating all those nasty meals that I really didn’t eat too much of because you couldn’t ..they were so bad… Oatmeal was the best thing on the menu for breakfast😳 I would definitely love for the CEOs to take a train ride from Chicago  to San Antonio or San Antonio to Chicago… We very disappointing and so is my mother… The trains are dirty the windows haven’t been cleaned and I don’t know how long🤷‍♀️ I have to say the guy that took care of us in our room did a great job! I didn’t see  him much, I believe the lady in the café car had him running back-and-forth like a crazy man dropping off meals etc. the attendant in the café car also told everybody pretty much when they had their conversations at front where everybody could hear she said “these people expect us to work 24 hours a day “well I’m gonna take my break she said… and if I’m not mistaken I even had heard them say that everybody got a raise at the top except for them! talking their personal stuff in front of everybody was not good… The atmosphere was just pretty negative The food was gross The train needed updating they need to clean the windows so we could see out better they definitely need to put the viewing car back!! not having that we were so disappointed… I asked the Attendant on the train Why we are getting a heated up pretty much TV dinner and where are the chef’s  that cooks anymore? She said those are on some other trains but not this one. I don’t understand why the other trains  can have good food on theirs and this one has nasty food and no viewing car but some of the others do? I found out through the Chicago lounge personnel that they only have certain trains that have viewing cars with the homemade food where there is a chef that cooks them… If you look at the advertisements they make it look so good and you think everything is the same but it is not so if you take a train make sure you look at what you get real close and ask questions because they make it look really good… ours was not a good experience at all… The only thing I really enjoyed was the ride and talking to some of the passengers… I really hope they look into the exhaust fumes that are getting into these rooms up top that I do believe is going to be a problem one day if somebody does not take care of that it is very strong and if you have kids up top it’s not gonna be good!… The only reason this one is getting two stars is because the ride is enjoyable the view is great! I really hope someone does their homework and checks into this and see how bad Amtrack is going downhill !! I did get $300back🤷‍♀️Wow!🙄 I hope Amtrack changes!!"

481,trustpilot.com,"AMTRAK VACATION DOES NOT EXIST!!!!!!!!!!So for any of you who know me know that me and my twin love to travel. We usually take a vacation trip for our birthday.  Well, this year we decided to pay homage to our father and ride the rails.  We had seen ads for AMTRAK Vacation and thought ""WOW that sounds fun, relaxing and we get to see the countryside.  We had seen these amazing pictures and videos of people enjoying these luxury trains with amazing views from big picture windows, fantastic meals and great rooms.  So we booked this very expensive trip to Niagara Falls, that included a roomette, priority boarding, meals, upgraded hotel room, Stage coach from Buffalo New York to our hotel in Niagara Falls New York close to the Falls and passage on Maiden of the Mist, our most expensive trip to date.   Yeah, were we in for a rude awakening!!!!  Our first red flag  was when a couple of weeks before our trip,  my twin received an email cancelling our Stage coach from Buffalo to Niagara Falls but per their policy(should have read that fine print) we were unable to cancel on our side.  It went downhill from there.  We got to Union Station and were going to check our bags but we weren't able to because we wouldn't get them back until we reached Buffalo.  Of course, we would need our clothes and toiletries for the ""luxury train"" that we would board in Chicago after our coach ride from Kansas, where we had an 8 hour layover, second red flag.   We thought it was worth the layover because we would be boarding our ""luxury train"" with our roomette.  Well, as you can tell from the pictures below it was a toilet closet.  Yep, that brown in the corner is a toilet and above that a sink that pulls out the wall.  They are also the steps up to the bunk that comes down from the ceiling.  For clarification on the pictures, I was standing outside the room, you can't stand when the bed is down, the blue curtains are part of the door, yep the ones touching the front of the bunk.  Oh and the straps, are to secure yourself up there so you don't fall off during the bumpy ride...no sleep for the weary travelers.  So I slept and sit beside a toilet the whole ride.  As you can also see in the pictures the train is old(probably in style when my Dad was a conductor and he died when we were fours months old)and it smelled like urine from previous passengers.  It was laughable!!! but certainly not funny.  Of course, we didn't use it...we trekked 2 to 5  cars over to use the restrooms in coach.  There was 1 folks yep I said 1 tiny shower stall for all the passengers(at least 12 rooms-double occupancy equals 24 folks)on the sleeping train to use and it was unaccessible.  We were unable to have a meal because the food was contaminated due to all the rain that was pouring into the train.  Our luggage also had to fit in the toilet closet with us.  There were no great vistas, you use the same rails as the freight trains and they have priority.  So you will find yourself stopped on the rails for hours.  Now after hauling luggage on and off of trains we finally get to our hotel(that we couldn't check in for more than 2 hours) we go to our upgraded double room and there's one double bed(after no sleep on the train)for two grown women to share and a view of the lumber yard across the street where we had to pay additional funds for incidentals.  Fortunately, we had ants(lots of ants) in our room so the hotel upgraded our room where we had a view of Canada, the nightly fireworks display and two double beds.  We were so tired we lost our first day in Niagara Falls.  We upgraded our tickets for Maiden of the Mist  to a tour of Niagara Falls well worth the extra money than stumbling around Niagara Falls with no idea of where to go, what to do, and how to get there.  Finally our last day I go downstairs to get coffee and realize that we have to check out of our room by 11 am and our train doesn't leave until shortly after midnight. So we either pay for another night or we schelp our luggage around for 13 hours or sit in a train station that long with our luggage. While dealing with the front desk at our hotel we are made aware that our accomodations and activities were booked through Price Line, while Amtrak paid Price Line 1/4th to 1/2 of what they charged us.All this to say AMTRAK VACATION is a hoax, scam or whatever you want to call it along those lines. If you're thinking AMTRAK then just DON'T!!!!!  Just fly and book through Price Line yourself.Niagara Falls is Amazing and an almost spiritual experience."

483,trustpilot.com,Made a reservation with Amtrak I needed to get an extension because I am in a wheelchair and I need a room I called today to get an extension on my itinerary and I was told they could not do it and all the rooms that I booked they said they have to give them away they said the only thing they have available it's coach seating and asked if they were going to finish me Mills and they said no I also told them I needed to be by a restroom because I am in a wheelchair and they only thing they said was I'm sorry will need to put you in code seating they were rude to me and did not help answer my questions
484,trustpilot.com,Late. Rude. Dirty. Never again.
485,trustpilot.com,"I will never step foot another Amtrak Train. Why? Where do I begin, First off leaving Chicago to The Glacier National Park in Montana was 3 hrs delayed. Once we left the Train was then 7 hrs behind schedule. I was scheduled to arrive at my Lodge in Montana at 6:30 pm. But did not arrive until 2:30am the next morning. Which made it difficult to get up at 7am for the planned Tour of the Glacier National Park included in my Amtrak Package. Every Train during my 2 day stay was delayed hrs. The Train leaving the day before my departure was delayed 12 hrs. People were sleeping in the Glacial Park Lodge for hrs waiting for their train. And the Glacier Park Lodge may be a historical Lodge but I found it to be a missable place to stay with no A/C in the room’s and no elevators. On the day of my departure the Train was on time. But once aboard many of us who had the rear sleeper car soon found out the A/C wasn’t working. The temperature in this car exceeded 100 degrees making it quite uncomfortable for many of us. The Porter in the car was dressed in Shorts and a t-shirt that’s how hot it was. The Porter at some point made an announcement saying we would all be refunded 100% of what we paid for that leg of the trip, And then later on went on and told us we would be refunded 100% of our entire trip. Which later turned out to be a lie. After making several calls to Amtrak they decided on giving me a refund of only $250 on a $4700 trip. This I found unacceptable and sent them a email telling them so which they have yet to respond to. There were other issues on my Amtrak trip which I won’t go into. But to be on a car exceeding 100 degrees on a 30+ hr trip was not only unacceptable but inhuman as well. I’m done with Amtrak. And if anyone has never rode Amtrak I hope you will think twice about doing so  after what I as well as others went through on the Train from hell."
486,trustpilot.com,"Took the auto train up and back in Florida to avoid the hassle of flying.  Arrived two hours late.  Returned 20 minutes early, then had to wait 90 minutes for my car to be off-loaded.  Paid for bedroom up and family bedroom back.  No bath room in family bedroom, at a premium price, with a bed only inches wider than the standard bedroom, and no control over the freezing room temperature.  Hindsight: flying less hassle than train."
487,trustpilot.com,"Elderly couples should be advised when booking sleepers.  Most cannot get onto the upper bunk and therefore must share the narrow lower bed -- most uncomfortable!  A Family Bedroom offers a lower bed for two that is just inches wider than the standard bedroom bed, costs a lot more, and doesn't have a private bathroom.  Older people want and need private bathrooms.  Perhaps the answer is to offer adjoining bedrooms so each partner can have a separate bed and a private bath.  If comfort and privacy has a higher price, I'd probably pay for it."
488,trustpilot.com,"I brought 4 tickets for my family from my pocket, but I am being told that each person should have their own reward system. That is not fair.  If it was not for me no one in my family would be riding because the tickets are too expensive. I have been paying for Amtrak tickets for my family, from young to old, for a very long time and did not know this was happening.  I was wondering why my points never gave back to me, but I thought it was because of the small amount Amtrak does give back.  The real reason for the lack of points was I purchased all of those tickets and was not getting credit for it.  With this knowledge I need to reevaluate my loyalty to Amtrak. Perhaps many of my family members should stay home if they can't or I will rent a car instead for our future trips. I gave two stars because the trip to our destination was great but coming back there were three delays and no communication.  All three trains were stalled. No one to talk to or explain what happen so the customers were all upset.  When they finally did attend to us everyone was at each other throat to get a seat.  This would not have happened if there was communication provided."
489,trustpilot.com,Our credit cards were stolen the day before the train so we didn't have access to funds. We don't carry cash. Amtrak personnel said in regards to it being freezing cold 🥶 that they don't give away blankets. Never have and they sell them they told us to stand between the cart when we obviously want to sleep. We spend alot of money riding these trains. I don't see why they're so tight on blankets.
490,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak used to be decent.  Been taken in from MA to VA for 30 years.  I understand mistakes and maybe schedule issues, but for somehow in williamsburg the last few times on the way down from the 9 50p to VA to the 174 5-6a to MA.  There's never a wheelchair.  The woman. On the way back is so rude.  She tried to pick a fight with me and I was not having it.  I take business class everywhere and this is not right.  I'm severely disabled so I need assistance.  On the way to williamsburg, at least they tried to help.  They brought out an office chair so I could at least rest.  The early morning woman was rude but there was a nice dude that calmed me down because I was biting that woman's head off.  I am going to file a complaint at a later time.  Other than that, I would give it higher marks.  It's just the physical pain this has caused is excruciating and unnecessary."

496,trustpilot.com,"Recently my friends and I attempted an Amtrak roundtrip from KC to San Diego. It was an extremely unpleasant experience. Not only were we unexpectedly told we were not allowed in the dining car due to CoVid (only the sleeper car passengers were) minutes after being awoken from our uncomfortable seats with an announcement telling us breakfast was served, but we weren't afforded pillows or blankets for our 2-night trip one way (no sleeper cars were even left when I booked). The train stopped after 12 hours so we could wait for the new conductor to be taxied in which took about half an hour (how they didn’t realize ahead of time they would need a replacement, I’d like to know). The train was going so slowly, a rabbit could have kept pace, and with how miserable the trip was panning out to be, at some point we gave up entirely on our destination and asked to be dropped off at the next town.  The conductor rolled right on by even as we pressed every alarm button we could find. Finally, we had to physically locate someone in the dining car who then located the conductor.  He acted cocky, smirking when we tried to explain what happened, and took no responsibility for our plight.  He brushed us off, saying we weren’t waiting in the ‘designated car’ to alight (???).  We ended up having to wait another hour to get off at the next stop and weren't even offered a taxi ride back so we had to pay for our own. Altogether, it was the worst vacation nightmare of my life so far.  I would HIGHLY warn anyone considering taking a train in the States.  Apparently, Amtrak is quite a monopoly, and poor customer service is what happens when there’s no competition.  I did give them one last chance to redeem themselves by filing for a refund request and were told that was their normal operating procedures.  My word."
497,trustpilot.com,I road the California Zephyr from Chicago to Denver and back in a sleeper room. It was dirty and the toilet did not flush. The thin sheets would not stay on the dirty mattress.

After yelling for someone to help finally attendant came and had to use a crowbar to open it. Could not give us another room. Told us if we had any problems in the night to ring call bell. Huh call bell did not even work. Bathroom not very clean and can't say the room was either. Sanitized? I don't think so. I watched someone leave room across hall and attendant only put in new bedding.ttip from Chicago to Rochester was fine. Train clean and everything worked well.Return trip was again horrible from Chicago to San antonio. Dirty and the electric outlet didn't work. Terrible experience this trip to NY.To make matters worse, I sent a letter to the amtrak headquarters over a month ago and have not received any response at all. I paid almost $5000.00 for two of us. What a waste of money. On a positive note, the attendants were very nice and tried to help."

506,trustpilot.com,"Would not recommend taking the Amtrak. Delays after delays after delays. We took the train from Newton Kansas to Chicago and it took almost 17 hours. Suppose to be 12!! The train is extremely dirty too.We didn’t pack as much food bc we thought it was only going to be 12 hours (most of that being in the middle of the night asleep..). Do not expect much from the “cafe” and I would recommended packing your own meals. The food is overpriced for the very processed, low quality food. We aren’t even taking the train on our way back because of how disappointed we were with our time on Amtrak. We will never be taking Amtrak again."
507,trustpilot.com,"I’m a young (22yo) woman and I was traveling home alone from VA to CT. I sat in the cafe car to get some work done, and I have a suitcase and a big bag with me. When I sat here, a conductor just told me I have to keep my bag out of the aisle, so I put my hard suitcase in the corner of the bench opposite me and my big bag next to me on my bench (there are no overhead storage shelves in the cafe car). A couple hours into the trip, a man comes and asks if anyone is sitting across from me. I said no, and that he could adjust my suitcase however he needed. There’s 75% of the bench still available for him. He looked at me like I was an idiot and said “can’t you put it under the table?” And I said I didn’t think it would fit under the table, and I was looking around for another solution when another Amtrak conductor came over and said “ma’am you’re blocking the seat.” I said “I know, I was told to keep my bags out of the aisle but I don’t know where else to put it” and he said, again, “well you’re blocking a seat”. I said “where would you like me to put my bag?” and he basically laughed, looked around, had no suggestions and just again said he didn’t know but I’m blocking a seat and need to figure it out. I pulled my hard case suitcase into my lap against the cafe table, and the conductor says to the other man “when we get to NYC, you can have your pick of any seat on the train (:”. I’m embarrassed and I’m really upset by this interaction. I don’t know what I did so wrong for these two men to look at me and treat me so condescendingly, like I was being difficult when all i asked was “where would you like me to put my bag?”. The whole car definitely heard and now I feel uncomfortable and awkward and I’m so upset that the conductor treated me like that, and coddled this grown, 60-something year old man as if I was being such an inconvenience for his life. Just tell me a place I can put my bag, I’m not intentionally blocking a seat!! I’m not trying to be difficult, I was trying to remedy the situation and the amtrak conductor absolutely treated me like I was an idiot causing this middle aged man such an inconvenience."

THE ONLY INFORMATION WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN IS TO ""CHECK WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE"" WHEN [IF] WE GET TO CHICAGO.

There was a diner we could order food from but weren't allowed to sit in the diner and eat. It was reserved only for sleeper cars. We had to take the food back to our cramped seats. When ordering food, there was a line of 20 people are more. From 5pm-8pm we weren't able to get any food as it was reserved for sleeper cars only. Alot of us were on the train for 24 hours cramped together, with no way of sleeping. We also have to stop alot to let freight trains through so always late.What was really irritating was the train was finally becoming less cramped but when we stopped in st Louis they removed a coach car and cramped everyone on the train again. A woman sitting behind me has a terrible cough and claims she doesn't have covid. The staff was informed of this and she was not made to wear a mask or anything. This is not the time to be cramping the train. I used to ride amtrak all the time and loved it. It seems they increased the cost and took away all the amenities that made the train fun. This will be my last trip on amtrak as they decided to reduce the quality of the ride but increased the cost. Very disappointing."

511,trustpilot.com,"I had booked a one way trip from Ann Arbor, Michigan to Chicago in Business Class weeks in advance only to arrive at the train station to be notified I was the only one among the four newly boarding Business Class passengers to be downgraded to Coach!I was told that the seats had been physically removed so there literally was no seat for me. I got stuck in Coach or I would have been stranded in Michigan, and had a loud, noisy, foot traffic filled ride that reeked of an amalgam of food smells from the cafe car, with little to no wifi service. Boo, Amtrak. I'm so done with you! I don't care to even book anything ever again with my 90,000 plus Member Rewards points. You lost two loyal customers in me and my husband  because you clearly don't care about your Members. What an insult!  I don't care what they said to me to try to convince me I was getting the same amenities as Business Class (and we all knows that's b.s), Coach is never the same as Business Class. I needed the quiet and the wifi of Business Class and instead I got a carnival of noise and smells with a constant parade of people walking up and down the aisle and into and out of the Cafe car! Not the same as Business Class at all. Next time, Amtrak will not be part of our travel plans."
512,trustpilot.com,"Traveling  from Lamy, New Mexico to Flagstaff, Az was an enjoyable way to travel, except Trains 3 and 4 were filthy, grimy, and unacceptable. Windows, bathrooms, floors, railings, deplorable!!! Are there cleaning standards!!! We are still under COVID alerts!!!! Some of the employees are grumpy, unhappy, tired. The intercom food announcers and conductor sound jovial and accommodating, that was nice to experience. All should sound and  act kindly. Lamy was such a disappointment. Lamy was filthy, grimy, unkept. Bathrooms were dirty and unsanitary.Floors and windows were dirty and unkept. Why can’t the manager step away and clean ?  Why???? We live in the best country ever. No excuse for filth!!!!! Please spruce up Lamy!!! Clean the place up!! Add flower barrels, shrubbery, spray down the outside walls and cement benches!!! Filthy. Make America clean and inviting!!! Please!!!!  The Government, State, Health Dept, Transportation Dept. need to clean this up . Send inspectors in to evaluate and experience what travelers experience. Hire folks and incentivize employees w travel vouchers."
513,trustpilot.com,DO NOT RIDE AMTRAK. THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO KEEP THEIR CUSTOMERS HAPPY. THEY ACT LIKE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING BUT THEY REALLY DONT. WE NEEDED TO BE INCONVENIENCED SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAME ONTO THR TRAIN CAN BE SAT TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH WE WERE NOT ABLE TO. WHEN WE CAME ON THE TRAIN WE WERE FORCED TO SIT APART THEN WHEN OTHER PEOPLE LEFT WE MOVED TO THEIR SEATS SO THAT WE CAN BE TOGETHER AND THEY SENT US BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL SEATS SO THAT THE NEXT GROUP OF PEOPLE CAN SIT TOGETHER. COMPLETE CRAP! PLUS THE FIRST TRIP THR CAR WAS 100 DEGREES AND DOWN A BATHROOM. AT ONE POINT THERE WAS NO BATHROOM AVAILABLE IN OUR CAR AS WELL BC THE WATER WAS SHUT OFF. TOWARDS THE END OF THR TRIPS THE BATHROOMS SMELLED SO BAD THAT WE COULDNT GET THE STINK OUT OF OUR NOSES AND THE CAFE FOOD IS WORSE THAN A SCHOOL CAFETERIA. PLUS THEY CLAIM TO HAVE WIFI BUT IT DOESNT WORK AT ALL.
514,trustpilot.com,"Update 9/21/22: I gave them a second chance. The tickets were booked 1+ months ahead of time as well. They were booked to a different destination using different trains than my previous experience. In the end, they canceled the trip again. They did not personally communicate this to me, did not offer alternatives, and did not offer a refund for their incompentence or for my inconvience. I had to contact them to receive a partial refund. THIS IS A SCAM. Why offer a service you cannot commit to? There are so many problems they need to fix! Their company prioritized upgrading luxury trains over functional equipment, more manpower, fair labor, and reliable accessibility. What a joke. So I cannot leave anything good to say about a company that has never serviced me beyond booking tickets. They'll never see my patronage again. (Stars updated from 2 stars to 1 star)Original: I am a first-time customer. Before I share my negative experience, I want to share the pro's first. It was easy to book and pay for a trip. The payment and refund confirmation emails are quick. The website formatted design and its UI interaction is well made. It's easy to navigate, accessibility provided to frequently visited pages placed on the bottom of the page. Information regarding the experience of the trip and their rewards system is mostly clear. Prices listed are what you charged; there are no hidden fees and full transparency in prices for various accommodations.My personal experience and rant:Now I attribute this experience to a set of unusual circumstances that could have been handled better. Hence, with website and mobile accessibility (through its app) and ease of booking, I have granted it a two-star review instead of one.I had booked a train to NY three weeks prior. There was a recent notification of a service disruption at Albany, NY posted on its social media and website. The notification came a few hours before my departure. An email was sent which had said, ""Don't worry, we've already set up alternate transportation for some or all of your route, and there's nothing you need to do."" I had reasons to worry; I lived 90 minutes away from the departure station and if I was denied service, then I would have wasted 3 hours and nearly half a gas tank. No further communication on said ""alternate transportation"" were given 2 hours later, either by website, social media, email, or phone call. I have been frantically checking for updates by such means as my departure time was approaching. My reserved tickets had disappeared, no longer listed, with my account on their website. The train status became listed as ""unavailable,"" which was listed as ""canceled"" prior. Having given up, I went to sleep. An update was provided on the website when I woke up. Alternate transportation, by means of a bus, was available for the train route, but no actual/credible information in whether my reserved trip was officially canceled or on-going. I called up and finally got in touch with a reservation agent. They did not acknowledge the service disruption nor any alternate transportation, things that were posted on the website. They had offered to modify the trip, but with no available seats on the upcoming 2 days on a time-sensitive trip, I requested a refund instead. Note: these are self-services offered to customers on their website. No advantages are given in calling their phone support other than ease of accessibility.I understand that the logistical communication of running a national transportation would be difficult, but not providing credible reassurance to its customers, lack of communication to its staff, and lack of consideration for time in the travel industry are reasons why I would not consider booking with Amtrak for quite some time.TLDR: My experience was bad. However, I believe that your current/prospective experience would be better based on the pro's I've seen so far from Amtrak."
515,trustpilot.com,"Horrible experience! We took Amtrak from Boston to Roanoke and both ways they had to change over the engine at Washington DC station causing us to be considerably late. After riding already for 14 hours it gets extremely frustrating. The bathrooms are disgusting because they don't keep up with the cleaning well enough and there was a horrendous smell of burning plastic, and what not,which who knows what that does to anyone's health."

517,trustpilot.com,I was trying to purchase a business class ticket and they said they were sold out. I purchased a coach ticket. When I was ready to board they said it would be standing only!!! I asked again if I could upgrade because somehow my friend GOT a business class ticket. They said they were completely full. Due to COVID i refused to be on a standing only train. I found another way home. I called my friend to see how crowded the business class had been and she said it was empty and she had an empty seat next to her the whole trip. My mother travels business regularly and it is always empty. I dont know what AMTRACK is up to but I believe they have some sort of scam going! They are also promising covid safety and packing people in like sardines! They need to cough up.my money.
518,trustpilot.com,"It was not a good first experience. I boarded the train and immediately noticed how filthy it was. Food containers and wrappers thrown all over the floor. The bathrooms were barely a step above portapoties… there was toilet paper and hopefully water all over the floor. I purchased a business class ticket and the seats were very nice, the chairs were able to recline. The staff was extremely nice as well. Preboarding the train I overheard a worker at Union Station say that there was a freight train broken down on the tracks. This being my first time I didn’t think anything of it and boarded. About 30 minutes into the ride, about 5 minutes out of Oregon City we were stopped for over 2 hours… The thing that irritates me is that they knew about the train breaking down ahead of time and didn’t give us a warning while we boarded. I could’ve made other arrangements and gotten to my destination on time. They had one super nice conductor on the train and I felt so bad for her because she had to go up and down the cars all night and deal with people frustrated with the delay. Needless to say, this was my first time riding Amtrak and will be the last. Too bad because it can be so much better!"
519,trustpilot.com,I bought two tickets for my son and I.  We were traveling 3 hours from San Diego to L.A. Even though we bought seats we were made to stand.  I am very hesitant to ever buy a ticket on Amtrak again if I am not actually guaranteed a seat.
520,trustpilot.com,"Tried for hours to book a ride from Klamath falls to Modesto CA.The Amtrak app kept failing to book the ticket returning with some bs error. I instead called and sat in the phone for nearly 40 minutes to book my ticket. The person on the phone claimed the ticket was $137 and when I tried to explain that the official amtrak app claimed that the ticket was $97 and I would use that except that the app kept failing on checkout she didn't care. I was forced to pay the outrageous price.The train was scheduled to depart at 10:08 pm, bus connection in Sacramento to Stockton, layover in Stockton before final train that was supposed to arrive in Modesto at 9:54I caught a ride to the train station (half hour drive) and waited around for the train. Until I got a automated message from Amtrak, the train was delayed an hour. I decided to wait around for the delayed departure but after a while I got another message saying the train was delayed another hour and a half. I decided to get a ride back to the house to get a little sleep. I set my alarm for 12:30 to give me time to get to the train for the new departure.When I got up at 12:30 to get ready to go I found I had another message delaying the train further. I set my alarm again. Got up again to find that the train had been further delayed . This happened 2 more times untill I finally left for the train station at 3:45am the train was scheduled to arrive at 4:15 but it got delayed again and didn't arrive untill 4:40At this point we were departing almost 7 hours late and I had been up all night constantly getting up and down without any sleep due to the incremental delays.Of course the train was filled to capacity. So there was no sleeping on the trip.The train was further delayed every step of the trip and we arived in Sacramento even later than our updated time and our bus had already left for Stockton 45 minutes before we got there and our new bus was delayed an hour and a half..I ended up booking a Uber to pick me up from the Sacramento station and drive me home which cost me another $120. If I had taken the chartered bus to Stockton and the train the rest of the way home I would have never made it to a client meeting that evening. (Arriving in Modesto 10 hours late!)Giant waste of time and money I can make the drive between Klamath and home in under 6 hours and it costs me less than $70 in fuel.Instead I spent $255 and wasted about 18 hours I should have just drove."
521,trustpilot.com,"My first trip with Amtrak was absolute hell. I took the amtrak from Kansas City, MO, to San Jose, CA. First train was 4 hours late, then because that train was late, we had to wait 4 hours for the next one then there was only a connecting bus available to get us to our destination, which was a 6-hr, extremely crammed bus in which we got to our destination at 4:30am. We were supposed to arrive the day before. There are very ghetto, rude people who attend Amtrak as well. Also, some of the staff are extremely rude. My second trip to come back to my hometown, one of the staff members loudly woke up a sleeping women to move her crap so someone at the next stop could possibly sit with her. He woke me and many others up. He then proceeded to make lots of noise for over 10min, getting ready to nap right behind me. My first trip, a verbal fight between two girls and the conductor happened, because apparently one women (who was drunk) tried to offer alcohol to the other womens kid. THEN, she played victim. Seats are also not comfortable overnight and I could not sleep for the life of me. And if u plan on sleeping while leaning on the side of the bus, don’t. The train will jerk you back and fourth, banging you against the side. Do not recommend riding Amtrak. Get a plane ticket."
522,trustpilot.com,"Took the Piedmont Raleigh to Charlotte. Left on time, smooth ride. Tickets cost less than gas and you can relax better than driving. Only downside: noisy passengers talking aloud on Bluetooth devices like they were in their own space. I recommend bringing ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones."
523,trustpilot.com,"If there were less stars I would rate it at that. We have travelled by car, airplane, and cruises, so we were excited to try out the train.  Our start point was in Provo Utah at what is a booth with some seats in it. There is No Restroom, no ticket service, no one there, a gross pay phone (not sure it works) and that is it. We were ready for our 4:35 boarding on 7/5/2022, but there was no train for 2 more hours.  Okay, we know issues come up when traveling.  When the train arrived I had to wait while one of the train employees kicked a man and his service dog off the train, no idea why, so I can't really judge that, but it was still surprising, especially since there is nothing at that stop.  After getting on the train, with no instruction for riding safely, we settled down only to hear the person on the speaker talk to us in an extremely rude fashion.  Only a couple of the employees were pleasant, but we were excited and tried to get along.  The observation car is really nice, but they do not keep the windows clean.  The restrooms were so upsetting. They were very unclean and we never saw them attended to.  My husband was never able to connect to the wifi on his laptop. The train had to stop multiple times, with no explanation to us, nor were we allowed off, and we crawled along at 5 miles per hour so, so much that our train was 5 hours behind by the time we reached Chicago.  I think part of the issue may have been caused because the train was so behind they hauled at high speed during the night to make up time and that caused some engine issues and was scary the way that speed felt in our seats. They hit a vehicle at some point, no injuries, but knocked out the electrical system som. It truly felt like were treated like prisoners on this train. We were not allowed off the train, except a couple of times for a couple of minutes, no exaggeration! This was the California Zephyr experience and I gave them the benefit of the doubt, until we took it back and the only difference was the man on the speaker this time was fun and informational. Other staff really need to find new jobs, they are not people friendly. The New Orleans train was so much better, friendly people, they cleaned the restrooms, and ran on time.  I felt traumatized by the CA Zephyr.  I had bruises from being thrown around, and my elderly father sliced his arm on something while trying to walk the isles.  There is too much to add, but my final nightmarish experience was getting back to the Provo Utah train stop on 7/13, we were supposed to be back at 9:26 p.m. and we did not get back until after 2 a.m. There were 3 ladies who were at that stop as well, one elderly lady, one with a prosthetic leg and one middle age helping them. They let them off the train and without any care at all for their well being at this bench stop, told them to call a taxi, I informed the train employee there were no taxis here and he said ""that's what happens when Uber comes to town"". I let him know we have never had taxis here. My  point here is they do not care about people in the least, not at all. Also, if you think having a sleeper car will make your trip better, guess again, these ladies had a sleeper car and they had a very loud noise the whole time in their car it was so loud they couldn't sleep and didn't feel well, but the train employees would not investigate, or do anything about it. They were able to use the dining car, because they had sleepers, which was so frustrating since I had been excited to dine in the dining car and when on board was informed it was only for sleeper cars, even if you wanted to pay for your meal, anyway these ladies told me they were also treated rudely by the staff in the dining car.  I won't even tell the story about how rude I was treated in the pitiful cafe.  This train needs to be completely overhauled, updated, have hand rails installed, maybe add some trains for scheduling help, and some of the crew need to replaced.  I highly suggest Amtrak do some undercover investigating on their trains and fix serious issues. We will never ride with Amtrak ever again! I will not recommend it to anyone I speak with either.  It was very disheartening for our first train trip."
524,trustpilot.com,"It started out rocky because the train was late and then our roomettes were changed so we were then in different cars which meant different dining times and the staff seemed aggravated or unsure about helping us be able to dine together. We also were unclear who our attendant was so that made it difficult to get help when needed. Then the train was delayed a total of six hours when all was said and done and walking around Denver at 7pm would have been much more ideal than waking around there at 1am. However, the train being late is just #trainlife and you have to expect it. And the staff warmed up once we got on our way. In fact most of the staff was very kind as well as helpful and with a good sense of humor. When you are going to see someone for the next 24 hours in a small box you hope they have a sense of humor. And we didn’t have to ask to dine together for the next reserved meal- they just made it happen and I appreciated that. The food was also pretty tasty and I am so glad we had a roomette and so a place to sleep during the night, although coach seating did not look as uncomfortable as I had expected. If I were to be on the train for 24 hours again I would get a bigger room - the roomettes are really great for one but a little tight for two. Overall it was a fun experience and I enjoyed the observation car but had great views from the roomette as well."
525,trustpilot.com,"Bought rails passes, $5k in folding bicycles, $$ deposits in car rentals, hotels and planned an epic 3 wk vacation cross country.  Loaded the app. Got my thicket for the lst leg to Chicago and then tried to add the rest of my family.  Told to ""call for children""...apparently could only get tickets through a live agent.  Good enough.  On hold 1hr, get disconnected.  Call back...request a call back and call back and wait on hold.  After 45 min on hold, I get my call back.  Ask to add my family.  Told me all trains to Chicago were full!  I asked for help from Audrey the Reservation lady to try to resolve, she transferred me to Customer Relations, where I remainded on hold for 1hr 29min, until I got a recording that, Customer Relations is now closed at 8pm to call back at 8 am and just hangs up. So now I have a ticket I can't use and can't get my family added, so I did cancel it.  Called back reservations to try to set maybe another day to start our trip...and after waiting 1hr 8mins I finally get Leah that says there is a ""problem"".  That our rail passes are only good for 120 days from purchase and will expire in 5 days.  I told her that even on her website it says that they are, ""good for 30 after your first segment"".  She says that is not what it means?!?!  She again tells me to deal with customer relations in the morning.  I told her I don't think I can get anyone one the phone and even if they did something, I can't spend 5 hrs just trying to get tickets for my family. She apologized telling me they were not ""running at capacity"". So I told her to just issue a refund.  She told me there would be a fee.  I told her right on your website it says a full refund will be granted within 120 days.  She says...let me research.  Comes back and says because I book my (cancelled) thicket it could not be a full refund.  I told her I booked nothing!!!!  That is why I was calling her...TOO TRY TO GET MY TICKETS BOOKED!  She said Customer Relations was the only one that could override the fee!  The $100 fee is well worth me and my kids never having anything to do with Amtrak. EVER.  Way to ruin a family summer vacation, cost me thousands in money and planning time and give my family the biggest disappointment ever to what was going to be an epic trip."

540,trustpilot.com,"My experience that I’m writing about is the first time I brought my dog. She is 10lbs and I paid for a ticket to bring her. She was in a carrier which are the rules. She was never out of the carrier. At times, her head was popping out for a little air. She never barked or annoyed anyone on the train, in fact I was sitting in the quiet car. A conductor came over on 3 different times to rudely tell me to put her head down into the carrier. I did while petting her to ease her anxiety. He then brought a huge woman conductor over to scream at me to tell me that I would be thrown off the train if my dogs head appeared out of the carrier. I express to her that she was being rude to me and she said next stop she was throwing me off the train and calling the police. I’m 57 years old and needed to get to my destination for a family emergency. This was disgraceful! The Amtrak police came into the car and escorted me out. They were actually extremely nice and respectful. They tried to get me on the next train and the conductor told them I needed a ticket and her train was full. As it passed by, it was clear that it wasn’t. The police then took me down to the ticket counter and the nice gentleman gave me a ticket. A normal  5hour trip took 8. These conductors should not be dealing with the public. They were rude and disrespectful. I am a small woman and my dog was 10lbs. The fact that they felt they needed to bring 3 officers on to the train to escort me off, was astonishing. I would not recommend bringing your pet on Amtrak. This was one of the worst experiences I ever had. I have to say that the last conductor on the train I finally was able to get on to complete my journey, was wonderful. He was a young man and helped me put my luggage up and helped me take it down when it was time to disembark. This last conductor and the kindness of the police and ticket man are the reasons I give Amtrak 2 stars otherwise this experience would be 1 to none."

547,trustpilot.com,"First, I am a disabled veteran. I boarded the Amtrak 4:20 train from San Clemente Pier to Anaheim on 6/25/2022.  My brother accidentally purchased a metrolink ticket vs an Amtrak ticket.  We were traveling with 9 people and heading to the Angeles Baseball game.  When he was boarding, the conductor, Matt Goldman or Goodman, who was extremely unprofessional, said he could not board with that ticket.  We asked if we could use the app to purchase a ticket once we were on the train and he said that we couldn't and that he wouldn't allow it.I have purchased many tickets on the app once I boarded after, and this was the first time this ever happened.  In addition, there is no mention of being able or unable to purchase a ticket once on the train anywhere online, near a kiosk.  The conductor also got in my face up close as if he was trying to intimidate me.  He said, ""are you boarding or not?""  By the way the train was 15 minutes late already.Just don't appreciate the rude behavior of an Amtrak conductor.  I have a lot of respect for railroad employees.  Matt Goldman/Goodman needs to be reprimanded for his behavior.  I do not deserve to be spoken to the way he did.  The next time I see him and he tries this SH** again, I will not be so polite!

552,trustpilot.com,"I had a trip out to the Grand Canyon from West Virginia.  The trip out was not too bad, though coffee was difficult to get (this was an Amtrak Vacation package where unlimited coffee and soft drinks were promised) however, not too bad.  It was very hot and the power went out a couple of times.  Also, the train was 4 hours late getting into Flagstaff.  On the way back Flagstaff to Chicago, the train was 7 hours late.  Yes, 7 hours!  This train's roof leaked and one of the tables in the Cafe car was rendered unusable because of it.  Power outages on this one also, and very hot on the train. I had a two day unwanted stay in Chicago because of missing my connection where I was put up in a very nice hotel, but no meals were included and I had not budgeted for that.  Also, I was sick.  It was 92 degrees at midnight in Chicago.  For awhile there, in my fevered dreams, I had it confused with hell.  When the two days were over and it was finally time to catch the train, I had Coach accommodations, though I had paid for a sleeping car.  I overheard people say it had happened to them before and Amtrak cheated them if they made a refund at all.  I'm still waiting to find out about that, but I already know I'm done with Amtrak."
553,trustpilot.com,"My experience with Amtrak was very poor. I tried to look at the positive parts of the trip such as the beautiful view and the smoke break (where we were able to get out), but overall was disappointed with the train. I wasn't impressed with the service, the delay was absolutely miserable, and the app wasn't much help at all. I did also notice how the security and cleanliness need some work. I think that flying would be 100% better, no matter how near or far. Amtrak was not my favorite type of transportation for traveling and I will never be traveling with them ever again."

I was supposed to wait 3 hours for  it. It was to arrive at 11a.m and didn't get there until 6 pm. I'm currently riding the train in Iowa. We were originally supposed to arrive in Chicago at 7, now we won't get there before midnight. There was a freight train breakdown which caused it to originally be late, which is understandable, but the more we continue the further and further we fall behind. If a train is late, you would think the conductor would try his best to make up time, not lose more. And this caused me to miss my connecting train in Chicago"

My ride from Chicago to Upstate NY that was supposed to depart at 9:30 PM left at 2:30 AM due to 2 ""mechanical issues."" How the hell does it take that long to fix things like that? Little to no accomodations or updates regarding the trip and staff were rude for no reason. We had numerous unexplained stops in the middle of nowehere and hung around stations for longer than needed. A trip that was supposed to be 13 hours, which is long for most people, was 24+ hours of nonstop annoyance and anxiety.Never, if you really care for your wellbeing, take Amtrak for any sort of trip. Save for a plane ticket or manage to catch a bus or drive. Anything but Amtrak. I'm going to fight for a refund on this trip."
563,trustpilot.com,"I had the worse traveling experience ever on Amtrak from June 1, 2022. I boarded the Silver Star 91 train at Newark, NJ heading to Kissimmee, Fl.  Before I boarded the train, the conductor told me to sit in seat 48. There was a white woman on her way to Miami in one of the seats. when I informed her that the conductor told me to sit next to her she moved into another seat until the conductor caught her in the new seat and told her she had to return next to me. According to the same white woman she was supposed to be in seat 27 but was seated in the wrong seat when I boarded the train because some person who doesn't understand English was in her seat. she said she decided to sit in the spot where I met her because she didn't want to get into an altercation with the non-English speaking man. She kept condemning this passenger for not speaking English. The entire trip she was extremely dreadful. She was drinking alcohol and smoking weed. She even purposely touched my thigh without my consent to ""reassure"" me that the wild coughing she was doing wasn't because of covid. I was wearing my mask, but she wasn't and made that connection. she was playing her music loudly and was talking loud to the point of yelling on her phone. She was repeatedly punching and pinching herself. She was cursing at the conductor demanding a seat change and threatened to shoot him. I was asleep when the confrontation started and the commotion woke me up, so I was able to hear everything she said. She even used the N-word. When we got to Washington, D.C. I told the conductor about the belligerent person I was seating next to. He said he would keep an eye out for another seat for me. I was not moved nor was she removed. She was constantly back and forth between her seat during the evening, so I was able to not be bothered much and sleep some. Then in the middle of the night, she grabbed all of her luggage and left to go to another seat to sleep. I thought the conductor finally moved her, so I was slightly relieved. However, at around 2:55 am she returned with another conductor arguing about sleeping in the wrong seat. She did the whole spiel about why she moved from this seat, but the conductor didn't care because he needed those seats for the customers boarding at the next stop. She was cursing loudly at this conductor too. Once again it woke me and some of the surrounding passengers. She used the N-word a second time, but this time it seemed she was directing it to the conductor because he is Black. The entire ride she complained to me about everything wrong with this trip on Amtrak. This is my first time going to Florida and I truly regret using the Amtrak. I was planning on taking a trip cross country on Amtrak in December, but doubt I will ever ride with this company again. I had an extremely unpleasant and unsafe trip because of this woman. I was shocked that the conductor allowed her to stay on the train after making such a threat. She was threatening to shoot your employee and they did not take that seriously. Especially since this was a week after a tragic shooting that left innocent people dead. We are close in proximity and in a closed area. What if she attacked me or the other passengers? The passenger in front of her said she felt so bad for me because she heard & witnessed everything. Even suggested that maybe the woman should sit next to someone white like her. There's a brochure in the chair pocket talking about customer safety instructions. the first thing it says is to tell your conductor when you see something suspicious or unusual, but they already knew the situation, and the conductors did nothing. They just ignored her. I dont want to believe that this behavior was tolerated because she is a white woman, but it's hard not to think that when such behavior is dismissed and other Black passengers have been kicked off for less. On top of that, the train was 3+ hours delayed. When I contacted Amtrak about my ride they gave a dismissive response about telling the conductors, but the conductor was told AND the irate passenger got into it with FOUR conductors about her behavior! This was terrible customer service and an inadequate response to something like this. This isn't my 1st time on the Amtrak, and there have been other off-putting experiences, but this is certainly the worst. I'll stick to flying. This was ridiculous."

Worst thing that happened after train to Chicago from Sacramento was 4 hours late, an Amtrak agent told us our luggage had already been transferred from baggage claim to train to Ann Arbor which was about to leave. So we got on that train and it pulled out immediately, That's when we discovered our luggage was not on it!  Spent HOURS trying to contact a human being at Amtrak with no luck.  Next day, we had to drive 5 hours back to Chicago from eastern Michigan to get our luggage.  Never again.  The food, however, was delicious.  That's the only reason it gets 2 stars instead of only one."

There is so much more but I won't cuss on here. I'm fuming. Instead of making all the excuse, say sorry and explain.  Riding from Chicago to Seattle. First we were  sent to the wrong car. After getting a good seat and getting comfortable for the long ride. They said we are in the wrong car and had to move. To seats that faced backwards. Down stairs by the smelly bathroom that was not working properly.  As I now feel sick. On a over booked train. Air turned off cause one person that didn't even stay in her seat said it was to cold. Making the rest of us to suffer. While she then went to sit in the lounge car. Where its even colder.  After a day they moved us to a spot up stairs. Finally.  Well I wake up from at the most a two hours sleep to a stainge man sitting in my husband's spot. I saw how that movie ended. 😬 Then the train braking down twice. Witch cause a two hour behind schedule. Then again had to stop right before spokane. The staff was at 12 hour on shift. I get it. It was 12 hours for them. But to sit on tracks for over a hour again. This time waiting for new staff. We were only 20 min from spokane.😪 Now at a 3 hour delay.  Witch at that time we were getting a room. The guy that was in the room before us had to let himself off the train. I had to bug people for a hour to get the room clean.  I got a quick ""sorry, not my fault!"" Followed by a ""I just woke up!""  Witch of course set my mood. Its now I feel  her attitude towards me. I wanted to reply ""Well thats good cause I haven't slept!"" As I said ""this will be the last time we take the train!"" It was a waste of  days when we  could have just flown. We thought it would be a good experience.  Well weren't we wrong."

Why doesn’t Amtrak get it together and provide nice transportation?! My father came to see me in from Washington. He got a sinus infection from the train, it’s that filthy. I called to cancel. They outsource the customer service calls. I had to call back because the first one couldn’t speak English. The customer service rep rescheduled it instead of cancelling the return trip.Amtrak kept the money and called it a no show. It’s happened to me, and my father. I wasn’t about to take that return ticket either. I had to call again after cancelling. Amtrak, if your going to charge money equal to the airlines at least clean the trains. The seats have to be from the 80s. Very uncomfortable, even in sleeper cars they call first class. My father cannot afford to loose one hundred dollars.

584,trustpilot.com,"To Whom It May Concern:We completed a two week Amtrak vacation on May 30.2022, leaving from Indianapolis, traveling to Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Washington D.C. and back to Chicago to Indianapolis.What was good:The hotels we were booked into were very nice and we enjoyed what we were able to do in a day in the cities we visited. The food in the dining car on the first three trains was exceptional. (though the selections were the same on all the trains that had a dining car and so, was quite repetitive.)Problems we experienced:We assumed this vacation was a group vacation and only after booking it, were we made aware that it was considered an independent vacation. The trip was not nearly as it was described. On the 6 trains we rode, there was never a shower on the floor with the roomettes. The roomettes are so small that when the bed is down, there is only a foot of space in which to stand and it was all but impossible to change clothes in that area. The upper bunk is so close to the ceiling on all but one train, that it was claustrophobic, not comfortable and difficult to get into for anyone over the age of 70. Customers should be made aware of that. My husband described it as being in a tomb.The restrooms on all the trains were not well kept and, in some cases, were dirty and had overflowing receptacles for used paper towels. That was a health hazard. Not acceptable.And a roomette with a commode in it?! If it were used, it would be like eating and sitting in a bathroom. Might be OK if a person is traveling alone, but without any privacy, it is not acceptable for those traveling with a companion or another individual.With the exception of one hotel, none of the hotels were in walking distance to the Amtrak station or to the activities that were included as part of the vacation which required hiring transportation to the hotels or tour pick up sites, to and from. We declined to use the voucher for hop on and off in Los Angeles as it would have cost $60 in transportation fees to use that voucher. Unacceptable. The Westin Bonaventure was a lovely hotel but there was nothing within walking distance except homeless people in tents. No restaurants or stores or acrivities.On three of the trains we rode, there was no dining car or observation car. We were told we would get 3 course dinners. The cafe car (which apparently replaced the dining car on those trains) provided food that was like something you might get in a highschool cafeteria. (A prepackaged brownie is not a great dessert!) The entre, heated in a plastic dish, was barely eatable. Unacceptable. The observations cars were also removed on those trains.had we known about these removals, we would not have booked on those trains.Only one of the 6 trains had WIFI. We were led to believe the trains did have WIFI. On the train from Chicago to Seattle, the Amtrak employee told me,“ I know it says there is WIFI but that really isn’t the case!)Because the trains were frequently late (over 2 hours, 4 hours in one case) we only had a day in each city, rather than the day and a half or two days which it appeared we would have.We were aware that our trip from Chicago back to Indianapolis would be via a Greyhound bus. What we were not aware of is that when we missed that bus due to our Amtrak train arriving more than 45 minutes later than scheduled into Chicago and we had to get our checked luggage (there was only an hour scheduled between the train arrival and our bus leaving. Poor scheduling, I think,) Amtrak did not want to help us and said it was Greyhounds problem! After much insisting, a supervisor was able to give us a voucher for Greyhound which, at first, was not accepted by the bus, but again, after much discussion, we finally were able to get on got a 5 hr bus ride to Indpls despite the fact that the bus did not have working seat belts. Bus 86381. Safety hazard.We have previously travelled by train in European countries and were quite pleased with our experiences. We are not so pleased with our Amtrak experience.We are anxious to hear Amtrak’s response to our “problems” with our two week vacation.We could not find anywhere to contact customer serviceHelen and Jim Welter,"

The stop in Anniston Alabama was so unorganized about  150 people got on they was drinking with their on liquor there was weed being smoked on the platform on break . Than today on the ride to Houston Tx the ticket agent had the nerve to tell me I couldn’t have a drink unless I payed for one from Amtrak. I was like why when yesterday was the party train and yal didn’t say nothing. The guy tells me it wasn’t this train. But last time I checked it had Amtrak on it. To top it off I had to listen to the customer behind me listen to Jazz all the way to Houston and he had no headphones. I guess they practice rules when they want to or just close they eyes to what they see when they want to see it.

591,trustpilot.com,Absolutely awful train was 40 minutes late which caused me to miss my connecting train. Conductor lies about how long it will be. Had me heated
592,trustpilot.com,"I have traveled on Amtrak trains several times. Todays experience has been the worst. Traveling to another state and the Status on app says on time, however the train is running an hour and a half behind schedule. I understand that the trains run late at times, however nobody announced it or came by to let people know that it was going to be that late. When you have somebody picking you up at the station an hour and a half late is a very long time especially when the app says the trains on time and you let the person know that. Experiences on Amtrak so I’m very sad to see that the service is gone this bad."
593,trustpilot.com,"We are repeat VIP riders of Amtrak.  On March 29th.  We booked a 3 week vacation using several trains from Chicago to LA to Seattle and back to Chicago to begin on June 2.  The long legs of the trip were booked in sleeper cars.  Roughly 6 weeks later, after paying for many hotels and car rentals for the trip, Amtrak calls and cancels the first leg of our journey.  They did offer us coach seats for a 43 hour trip, we are seniors by the way, supposedly due to covid.  NOT!  What a travesty to offer seniors coach seats for 43 hours due to covid!  We are still fighting with cancellations, have a very disappointed family and 2 very angry seniors!  No future discounts offered but they did generously not charge us a cancellation fee!  They are overbooking trips and pushing coach for bigger profits at the expense of the customer!  What would have happened if we got out their and they cancelled our trip back?  They have become unreliable in my books!  Amtrak travellers beware!"
594,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak is absolutely awful.  My coworkers and I got on the train and wanted to sit together in the food car where there are tables.  Two were free.  The cafe car server (Morise) told us the sits were taken, we sat else where.  I then got up to use the restroom and saw that there were two people sitting in those seats and they were not employees.  We then went to the food cart and asked for drinks, we were told we could not get anything due to the machine being out.  Then we over heard his say- if you are in business class, they could get drinks.  We were ALL in business Class!!  ANd they denied us. They some one else that works for Amtrak screams from the back to us in front of the entire car of people.  Who does this????  The customer service is by far the worst I have ever seen. I have never been treated so poorly. I would give a negative 5 if I could--- Unfortunately Amtrak has a 1 Point service because you can not give a review without hitting 1.  PS  Train 193 -- Conductor or Asst Conductor (NO NAMe gtag)  I can not tell you her name- no name tag"
595,trustpilot.com,"We took the California Zephyr sleeper car service from Chicago to Grand Junction, CO.  Overall, I rated this a “3” but there were some good and bad points that average out to a “3”.GOOD POINTS:  FOOD - The food service has improved significantly.  We had great food, white table cloth service, and a complimentary glass of wine with our dinner.SERVICE - A number of people on the train worked hard to provide excellent service.  I particularly want to mention “Reesey” in the dining car staff who was exceptionally good.SCENERY - The observation car is nice and the scenery in Colorado is excellent; however, there are only a limited number of seats available.BAD POINTS:CLEANLINESS - The inside of the windows in our bedroom were absolutely filthy with dark black dirt that obstructed our view.   There was no capability for cleaning them on the train so we had to do the best we could to clean them ourselves with Kleenex and water. Several other reviews have mentioned this same problem.SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS - The sleeping accommodations are very tiny and difficult to move around in and the “shower” shares the same tiny space with the toilet which makes it almost impossible to use the shower.  There is also insufficient water to take a shower.TRACK  CONDITIONS AND SLLEP – in some places, the tracks were well-maintained and the ride was relatively smooth; however, in many areas the tracks are not well-maintained and the ride was very rough.  For that reason we were not able to sleep more than about (2) hours at night.SCHEDULE - We wound up being over an hour behind schedule and there didn’t seem to be much effort to get back on schedule.WATER SUPPLY - At about halfway through the trip, the train ran out of water so that we could no longer even wash our hands.PUBLIC REST ROOMS - The public restrooms do not have flush toilets so it is like using a bad port-a-potty."
596,trustpilot.com,They added an additional 7 hours to my ride. Took away most of the smoke breaks. The the train showed up LATE on top of everything else. START LOOKING FOR YOUR AIRPLANE TICKETS AHEAD OF TIME. Amtrak is only good for the price
597,trustpilot.com,"Absolutely the most disgusting experience I have ever had in a train. Round trip from Portland to Anaheim in a family sleeper was horrible. The train was filthy. The walls were black with dirt, trash in our room, closet broken. We were in a bottom level and the attendants on both trips were non existent. Nobody checked on us once, or turned our beds down or help us put them away. Nobody took reservations for meals, changed out our trash cans. The bathrooms were horrible, full of urine snd poop in the toilets. The food was swill. Nobody offered to help with our bags and just stood and watched us struggle to get on board. I have never felt more disgusting in all my life and I paid three thousand dollars for this? The windows were so filthy, the steps and the floors were so gross. I could go on and on but it just makes me panic to rehash it. It was hells train and I’m never ever taking Amtrak again. They give ZERO cares about you."
598,trustpilot.com,"The five star because of the hospitable and kind staff. First encounter was Elizabeth (Liz) at the Orlando Sligh station. With a smile Liz did not tire of answering my questions.  I approached her three different times while I waited for my train.This was my first use of Amtrak. Liz was friendly, informative and welcoming. Then aboard the sleeper all the way to NY and back I met with the busiest, most diligent and hospitable Service Attendants ever.  Their goal, obviously was to please. My most favorite in the sleeper wereRodney, John and Preston. These guys were also outstanding in personality with a great sense of good humor, while waiting on everyone hand and foot.  The only guy serving in the pantry during all three meals going and coming (forgot his name) was also very professional and friendly.  My roomette was cozy and quaint. It had a toilet and sink with running water, so clever and useful. It had toilet  paper and soap, just like a hotel. I would have no problem traveling in a roomette again.  I love to fly, love airplanes but you can't roam around the airplane. You can't get coffee anytime you want it on the airplane. You can't walk to the diner or snack bar on an airplane.  Folks can sit at dining tables and play cards or other board games or just talk and laugh or stay in your room and read or listen to music, etc. Before you know it you've reached your destination.  What a neat way to travel.  If you have the time, take an Amtrak. I will again for sure, not squish or cramp on an airplane. My daughter ditto my remarks."
599,trustpilot.com,Well this is about their website more than anything else. Ive enjoyed pleasant experience that were way better than having to drive where I was going because that would have required me to drive through the filthy cesspoll Detroit of the northwest emerald toilet formerly known as Seattle. So I go to buy my girlfriend a ticket to the liberal bum infested homeless encampment called Portland (thank you amtrak for making it so I didnt have to drive to that rectal birth) and I entered all her info like name and birthdate and went on to pay with my credit card and the system goes and puts the ticket in my name. They had to have known about this because when I finally was able to talk to someone they changed it without question so they know about it. Im not sure why they have it set up to do that but I'll bet it was the  brainstorm of someone in HR. Then she gets an email saying that she needs to do some covid bs online test so she clicks on the link in the email and it takes her to the amtrak site and theres nothing there about covid but thats how it should be I guess and she didnt have to do any covid bs testing when she came here on the train. That could be a local anti American liberal Washington state requirement. Basically amtrak is ok despite some of the people that work there that think backwards. The lady that helped get the ticket fixed was great and fast and fixed it correctly. The person that thought up that way should start out at the bottom there being a janitors assistant and work their way up to a level where they make decisions for the company.

601,trustpilot.com,"My first train trip on Amtrak- travelling DC to Norfolk. While waiting in the terminal it appeared this is also a spot for homeless to nap, and finding a spot to sit was limited.  I decided to go business class, assuming better travel comfort-good news- seats are large, lots of lots room, wasn’t crowded on my trip. Bad news, there was no conductor to help with onboarding at the biz class car, but they were there at the coach cars. A fellow customer helped me with getting up steps with my bag. I used the bathroom- it was filthy- strewn with paper, urine on the floor, and even a food container on the floor from the overflowing trashcan. I don’t know what restrooms were like in coach- but this was awful. As I walked through the other cars to check things out, I question what the benefit of paying almost twice as much for business is. Im hoping that the bathroom thing was a fluke-"

604,trustpilot.com,Been on hold for over 40 minutes now. I guess in the entire company there is only a couple of people capable of answering the phones. this is absolutely ridiculous. Not to mention your website offers no helpful information or actual virtual assistance just an automated computer response that doesn't actually help.
605,trustpilot.com,"My family recently (4/25/2022) boarded a 4-day cross-country train (2-train segments) from DC Union Station to LA Union station. I had booked the tickets several months ago and had done extensive research as to the amount of baggage 3 pax are allowed to check and carry on. We had several 24"" sq boxes to check which is clearly allowed by Amtrak (as long as under 50lbs). Unfortunately for us, the two women working the baggage check were some of the most aggressive, unhelpful and unfriendly people I have ever dealt with. First, they complained profusely that we had boxes, although Amtrak policy allows shipping boxes. Then they, and others, complained profusely that I'd put 'Fragile' stickers on the boxes (nothing we packed was breakable - the stickers merely an attempt to encourage safe handling - which they told me wouldn't happen as the boxes would get thrown around anyway!). Only when I finally said, ""just take the stickers off the boxes!"" did they stop complaining about them - so why give us such a hard time in the first place?!  Then, when it was discovered one box was overweight, it was as if it made them happy to reject our box! We then split our belongings into multiple boxes so as to lighten, and the only other thing that made them happy was collecting all the fees for extra boxes, baggage and bike-shipping - which they accused me of trying to sneak through (?!!) WE were the ones stressing about the large amount of checked belongings and their completely unhelpful and snide attitude made the entire experience a total nightmare! These two Amtrak employees had clearly been at the job too long and really should retire. If it weren't for the TOTALLY AWESOME calm and friendly Red Cap fellow that helped us get our baggage from outside to inside (and stood by us almost to the end of the ordeal) I would have totally lost it (and I am extremely remiss that Mr. Red Cap disappeared before I could tip him)! What a horrible, stressful way to start a trip that we had been planning for months."
606,trustpilot.com,"I’m a fairly regular long distance AMTRAK rider on the Empire Builder. I enjoy the company in “first class” — the sleeper patrons. A few years ago the EB even offered a wine and cheese event between Montana and Wisconsin. But AMTRAK must depend on a government budget from year to year.  So long, wine and cheese!  Cleanliness is crucial to travelers! AMTRAK in general rates a C-  at best! The cars are old, creaky, and getting older, but to make up for it, please can you make them spotless! Especially and constantly the bathrooms and windows. After all, it’s a very pricey ride. Yesterday, we took the auto train from Florida. Because of the misguided policy decisions of our current Whit House, staffing has collapsed on this train. And quality control and supervision seems especially wanting and lazy.  What really turned me sour was the food and food service.  The famous AMTRAK steak was served not just rare but raw! There were only two people running the kitchen. Uncooked! I fear that the careening decline of AMTRAK mirrors that of our country. So sad."
607,trustpilot.com,"Upgrade to Business class definitely not worth it!! We rode coach to SC and literally had more leg room. On our way home, we upgraded, paid more to have LESS leg room and our seats were facing 2 other passengers!!! To make matters worse, our seats were up against the wall, so much for extra reclining. I'll ride coach anytime."
608,trustpilot.com,"When was the last time Amtrak washed the windows on their passenger cars? I've ridden Amtrak trains twice in the past year, roundtrip from Carbondale to Champaign. Each time I was unable to enjoy the views because of absolutely dirty windows. This needs to be addressed by Amtrak. What's the point of traveling by train if you can't enjoy the landscapes you're passing through? I think I'll drive next time - even at age 75!"

610,trustpilot.com,"Deserves zero stars.  I purchased a ticket on an evening train from Stamford, CT with a connection in new haven, Ct-final destination Massachusetts.  The train out of Stamford was extremely delayed-in fact it did not show up at all as I waited for 45 minutes.  I was explicitly told by the Amtrak officer at the station that the connecting train in new haven would NOT WAIT for this train to arrive-leaving me stranded overnight in New Haven which is neither a safe nor feasible option.  Amtrak was unable to fulfill its contractual obligation of the ticket that they sold me.  I had no option but to leave and pay to get a car ride back to Mass. Amtrak is refusing to issue a refund for the unused ticket."
611,trustpilot.com,Website is terribly  designed. Super flaky I can tell you so many things that are wrong with it. It’s sad to believe that such a large company has one of the worst websites of anyone.Shame on you Amtrak. Get a web designer and make sure it works on all platforms. I’ve been using it for a couple of years and I am aghast at the sad state of the Amtrak website
612,trustpilot.com,"Good morning. Wanna make complain on staff in train and Washington train station of Amtrak. The serving personal rude and don’t know their job. On my way, Nyc-Washington I carried a pet. During all trip the staff on train stress me and my dog out. The person in my car complained about me carrying the dog on my hand without asking any documentation of emotional support. In the end, when I said about certification for emotional support of my dog the same person allowed me to carry the dog. The person said that if this is emotional support I was no supppsed to pay fee for the pet. By reaching Washington DC Union Station, I went to Amtrak Tickets Box to ask how I can return paid money for carrying the pet since the staff on train said I don’t have to pay for emotional support animal. I met supervisor, the Mr Banks, who in emotional, far from professional way, start scream on me about Amtrak working just with service dogs and have nothing to do with emotional support. Mr Banks, called himself supervisor  and resist to give any assistance with reaching out his farther management. I was so stressed out and confused by different information from different unprofessional staff of Amtrak. I just left in distress and called the hot line of Amtrak . The lady on the phone with hot line of Amtrak told me about Amtrak no having special policy for emotional support animal but she said I allowed to carry the pet on my lap since it’s emotional support. Also I asked to connect me to department in order to leave complain for Mr Banks. I never got the chance to reach the department because waiting on the phone line took more time than expected so I left request for call back. No one  from Amtrak never reach me to make my complain about Mr Banks in life. On my trip back to Nyc on 6:20am April 15 2022 from Washington DC I met again unqualified unprofessional rude staff of Amtrak. The lady ( unfortunately didn’t get chance to get the name since she was stressing me out and acting rude ), who met me in front of the train, ask me to close the carrying bag with the dog. For the first time on Amtrak staff asked me close the bag. On my question why she asked me to do that the lady start yell on me and advised me no to show up on her eyes and walk to the last car so she can’t see me. I hope Amtrak has the cameras with recorded sound to track such unprofessionalism of the staff and stop abuse of customer. Moreover, the website ask for release form for the pet. I haven’t been ask for such form on traiN NYC-Washington 12 April 2022. On train Washington-Nyc 15 April no one ask me the form either. But in Union Washington train station theory in tickets box ask to fill the form and was asking no in nice way to show up if my carrying bag be able to close with my dog in. It was no great experience for my 7 month puppy, 6am in the morning, carrying her in and out as a toy, in order to show up the staff of Amtrak how works specialized for up to 16 pounds dogs  bag. And I see no reason for this because no one ask anyway for the form on train itself. So why the staff of Amtrak stress out customers who paying for service in such way. I’m asking to check all possible cameras in order to confirm all provided by me information above and consider my complain seriously and provide corresponding commission or discount for paid tickets on 12/15 April 2022 for me experiencing stress caused by staff of Amtrak. I got most awful experience on train with my pet because the no clear policy for pets on Amtrak websites and regulations and lack of needed training of staff who presents company called Amtrak. Please consider my complain with fair and I’m gonna be waiting reaching me out Amtrak in order to resolve this issue."
613,trustpilot.com,"On Friday April the 8th 2022, my sister and I rode train #90 [palmetto) from Fayetteville Nc to Richmond Va. What a great ride. The staff was outstanding.  Very professional and courteous. It was my sisters first ride on amtrack. However, I rode the train #89 back from Richmond Va to Fayetteville NC today.  The entire staff was very rude and unprofessional.  Let's start from the beginning,  as I approached the train to board the conductor was rude from the start. He asked me and my husband to step back because he was trying to get people off the train. First of all,  that was not my husband.  It was a perfect stranger. We were both riding alone. I finally get on the train and he tells me I'm in seat 1A. Which at that time I went to my seat and It was taken already,so he put me in another seat. As the train was taking off he moved me once again to the seat with the gentleman he thought was my husband.  After about 10 minutes he came and moved me again to my original seat. The person I was sitting beside in my original seat smelled like octopus.  I turned and put my feet in the isle and put on a extra mask to keep from smelling octopus.  He comes by and tells me to get my feet out of the isle and sit in my seat properly.  I asked if I could please move to another seat. He put me back with the gentleman that he thought was my husband.  To make a long story short,  don't assume. Also, I needed water to take my medication because I'm a diabetic.  I went to the concession cart and was told it was closed. They said they made an announcement,  but no one in my car in business class heard the announcement.  I paid extra to be in business class and I didn't even have a tray in front of me for my laptop. Neither could I plug in my charger because the lady sitting beside me had the plug blocked with all of her belongings.  Also, the gentleman working the food cart was very rude. When I ask him if they had coke or Pepsi his response was what do you see. I said never mind just give me a coffee. Conductor did not help with luggage getting bags on or off. Stated you should only bring what you can handle. Very bad job train #89.I felt I was harrased the entire time."
614,trustpilot.com,Amtrak was already falling apart and now they've asked for the tsa to step in and screen for them. I will never buy another Amtrak ticket and neither will my family or friends as i spread the word. Bad move for an already failing business to contract tsa. Enjoy bankruptcy.

616,trustpilot.com,"I paid over $1,600 for a recent trip March 19 from Lakeland Fl, to Boston, MA. We had a roomette with business class seats from Washington to Boston. Our roomette was supposed to come with a toilet. Didn't happen. We had to travel through 3 cars to the closest toilet. I upgraded our roomette to a bedroom on the return trip and it was nearly $700 more. Our train from Washington back to Lakeland was over 2 hours late. We arrived over 3 hours late back to Lakeland, FL. No apologies or compensation. Trying to sleep like was being on a constant roller-coaster ride. Plus the suffering of having to wear a mask. We will never again give Amtrak our business. We could have flown 1st class up and back for less money."
617,trustpilot.com,"This review applies to Mr. Thomas in Customer Relations not Amtrak in general. Mr. Thomas I hope this message reaches you. He provided EXCEPTIONAL customer service and concern for my issue. There was a situation on train 92 on this past Friday in Cary, NC  in which a passenger inflicted self-injury which had the train stranded for over 3 hours. I was offered vouchers for future travel, but the seriousness of that situation has prevented me from wanting to travel due to no baggage checks for weapons. my father is ill in New York and it was imperative I got to my family. I had my daughter with me who experienced that traumatic scene. I did not get to my family until the following day. Mr. Thomas provided me a refund on my return trip. I missed the call back from his supervisor to boast about how amazing he is. Mr. Thomas deserves a raise. He deserves praise. I have never encountered a rep like him before with Amtrak. He is positively the best."
618,trustpilot.com,"If you don’t pay for a roomette be prepared to have nothing but a chair.  You will only be allowed to e it the train every thirteen hours which is unacceptable for my service dog to be denied going outside at a stop that we are literally stopped for 15 minutes.  Hot food and the dining car are for privileged only but the conductor sure makes enough announcements to the sleeper car passengers. Hey Amtrak you’re still conducting business with segregation practices that are outdated.  Sad I’m standing here hungry, my dog needs to go to the bathroom, and we haven’t been let out in 5 or 6 hours even though we’ve stopped 3 times.  The poor people bathroom is filthy .  My feet stuck to the floor.  The poor don’t get their bathroom cleaned.  Only the elite that spend 10 times more .  This extreme division of classes reflected in the “privilege” that comes from Amtrak really shows in the way the coach class people are treated and spoken to.  Come on Amtrak step it up.  Don’t you want to be a progressive service and hospitality provider directed at human beings instead of catering to the rich and spitting (literally all over the bathroom sink) on the peasant in coach?  Despicable!!!! I’ll never ride again"

Their is no social distancing. They implement these so called rules but they don’t enforce their rules is a waste of time. Was riding on the Silver Star 91 Car # 25120 going to Tampa and in the wee hours of the night 1:00am we had a man with a prosthetic leg who was drunk with another passenger carrying out like 2 clowns and no Amtrak employee was not around to stop these 2 drunken fools from being jerks.

621,trustpilot.com,"I was anticipating my first train ride to New Orleans but was totally disappointed after being the first one (in our group) on the train and the seat me and my mom had was WITHOUT a window view.  I asked the attendant to be switched so that I could look out the window and take pictures (past time favorite) but she was rude and said that the seats were accounted for.   We actually had 3 members in our group who decided to fly back instead so space was available for me to be moved. I believe if I paid to travel by train, I should have been able to view the beautiful scenery as well. I think those seats (without a view) should be for the staff. I will not recommend traveling by train unless it is one's choice for a seat without a view."

623,trustpilot.com,"I just filed a claim and I kindly ask that someone get back to me with confirmation that we'll receive some acknowledgement of the mistreatment and unnecessary hardship we experienced on Saturday February 26th, with Amtrak. And also, to reassure me that nobody else will ever go through what we did. All of the details are captured in the case file. In short, my family took the auto train from Lorton to Sanford on Saturday February 19th for our winter vacation (without incident -- it was an excellent experience). On February 26th, our return date, we were told we could not get on the train because our vehicle was too large. HOW COULD THAT BE? They took us down there. For over an hour we begged and insisted we needed to go (we have small children, and had to get home to New York). We were turned away without question, without negotiation, and without any investigation into a solution. And most importantly, without any care or compassion. They told us to go to an auto parts store up the street and have our mirrors removed from the car. That would be the only option. And to leave the lot otherwise. I begged for help.  Literally, my family was stranded in Florida. In the end, we had no choice but to drive 20 hours home to Long Island. Plane tickets weren't an option.We paid for tanks and tanks of gas and put a thousand miles on a brand new vehicle. Paid for a hotel and tolls. Paid the price of exhaustion. Please, I would like for someone to explain to me how Amtrak can bring us down to Florida and then completely strand us there. Without a plan. Without any effort to help us get home.The Customer Care Representative I spoke with, and who helped capture the situation and file the claim for me was very kind and empathetic. I appreciate her very much. That said, I do expect a call from Corporate to confirm receipt of this complaint and acknowledgement that the situation is being recognized for how terrible it is and that the individual that mistreated us and offered no help or solutions will be tended to. Trust me, you really don't want someone like that representing Amtrak.And finally, it would be the right thing for Amtrak to not only offer an apology, but to reimburse our family for all of the unexpected, last minute travel expenses we incurred driving all the way from Florida to eastern Long Island."
624,trustpilot.com,"Really, the worst customer service ever. Tons of unnecessary menu interactions on their automated line, inflexible policies, such as taking 72 hours to apply points to your account (WHY??? this is a digital transaction! I gave you the money, give me the points), refusing refunds for unapplied points, sending tickets where one leg is coach despite having paid for business class... I could go on. This is just a terribly run company with antiquated systems and customer service that reflects their monopoly on rail travel."
625,trustpilot.com,"I have to take this train to get to and from school, every train has been late by at least 45 minutes. The current train I am waiting on is already 1 hour and 30 minutes late and continues to further delay. When the trains are cancelled they don’t send a text or an email informing consumers until 12 hours after the scheduled time. Workers at the stations and on the train always have a negative attitude and have no problem being disrespectful to you or your family. When there is a problem on the train no employee takes initiative to control the problem instead they give them a warning(3 warnings until they get kicked off) however after their 3rd warning odds are they are already at their destination. Worst of all the employees nor the company takes no notice of consumer complaints and further does absolutely nothing to prevent the same or similar issue from happening."
626,trustpilot.com,"If I could give this ride a 0 rating I would. I usually have a decent experience but this train sucked. They are always running late but this train was over an hour behind. I won’t be getting home until almost 1230 when I was supposed to be arriving i at 1040. We stopped multiple times for around 20 minutes each time. There were screaming children behind me and everything for food and water is overpriced. The kids behind me keep kicking my seat. I am so dissatisfied and pissed off honestly, I spend a lot of money to have a short ride but it is never the case."
627,trustpilot.com,Every single time I ride with Amtrak there is a problem. From delays and terrible service to random cancellations. They also use marketing schemes to create a sense of urgency when buying tickets. Frequently I see “Only 1 seat left” and then the next hour that’s gone. I have no other option but to ride with them sometimes and they KNOW this is the case with many and they take advantage. No train ticket should be as expensive as they commonly are with the terrible service provided. Ridiculous.
628,trustpilot.com,"Avoid Amtrak at all costs!! I was quite enjoying my trip from Reno to Salt Lake City when the issue of our delay came up. I understand that another train derailing it's not something that could necessarily be controlled by Amtrack. But, the cause of my displeasure is not necessarily the derailment but how it was handled. First off, the intercom said that announcements would not be made until 6 a.m. unless there was an emergency. I think backtracking to Elko and having a 12-14 hour delay is cause for an emergency yet no announcement was made. I was woken by a confused call from my family that I hadn't arrived. When I asked I was told the situation first apathetically and then very defensively from the employees in charge. One employee loudly accused passengers for being ungrateful that we were still alive and raising his voice to tell calm passengers to calm down. The only option for food for coach passengers was to purchase overpriced junk food from the snack bar and a small complementary bag of cheez-its. Given the unexpected and long delay, I think the coach passengers should have been fed in the dining car even though that's not included in their ticket. Or at the very least be offered junk food complimentary more than a small bag of crackers to tide us over for hours. I and several others had people that could pick us up from Elko but we were not allowed to leave the train. I was told this was because we could not block the Elko station but we could have easily pulled up to let people out that wanted out and then go back to the train yard where we had been sitting. I was told aggressively by one of the employees that he would be fired if he let me off the train. When the buses arrived to take us to Salt Lake (8 hours after we were supposed to have arrived at Salt Lake originally), there was only one employee that was authorized to move checked bags so we waited in the buses for over an hour as one person had to personally move every bag to and from the Bus and Train. There were many passengers, including a man and his son that I met on the trip, that decided it was not worth all the delays and wanted to go back the way they had come since the train was going to be going back that way anyways. These passengers were instructed to buy an additional ticket to go back even though they would not be receiving the trip that they paid for in the first place. That is absolutely ludicrous. Not only that but we all were directed towards the customer hotline that was obviously overrun by calls given the situation. But, I had tried to call the same number the day previous before the derailment to extend my ticket to Provo. I was on hold for about 45 minutes before an employee told me to just wait until we got to Salt Lake because no one was ever going to answer. What good is a customer service hotline that everyone is directed to if no one answers even when there's not a crisis? The 45 minutes does not include the 10 minutes that I was shouting at the automated response my confirmation number which it continually got wrong. I was told by repeat customers and employees that to ride the train is to always take a risk especially recently as it sounds like the freight trains are doubling up their trains which are more likely to derail. This was my first train ride and I did not see a warning of this kind anywhere on the website. I even went back and looked and all I found was a Blog about how much better riding a train was than another kind transportation. If these kinds of delays are expected and frequent there should be warning when the ticket is purchased so that customers can make an informed choice. As someone who never rode a train I was almost ridiculed by others that I did not seem to know this. I find Amtrak understaffed, unprepared, and indifferent to the experience of their customers. I will not be repeating this experience again and I have actively been telling all in my acquaintance to avoid Amtrak at all cost. I have been waiting several days to file a complaint on the customer service hotline as I do expect it to be backed up for days given that it is obviously understaffed."

631,trustpilot.com,"I recently rode the Amtrak from Tampa to Ft Lauderdale and back (roundtrip) to go on a cruise. the ride going was ok. My beef is that on our return from our cruise which we docked at 7:00am when we get to the Amtrak station around 8:30am We find out that the station doesn’t open until 11:30am. So we were stuck outside the station for 3 hours waiting for them to open. No accessibility to bathrooms.  That is ridiculous. When you have travelers coming in especially from a cruise ship which always dock in the early morning, the stations should be opened at least by 9:00am. At the very least let the passengers know ahead of time what time the station opens. ( maybe print it on the ticket somewhere. I’m a VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER."
632,trustpilot.com,"I love trains but. I was disappointed upon learning the dinning was for sleeper passengers only, I was looking forward to purchasing a nice breakfast for myself and wife we have in the past. Two frozen breakfast sandwiches nuked in a microwave for ten bucks ? Then for dinner a mad rush through the union station Denver to find something to eat? The service was lousy, was told because of covid, cutbacks in staffing necessitated the changes in service. The ride I would give 5 stars over the Rockies on the Zepher has been a dream of mine that didnt disappoint.  To the crews I get the frustration on being shorthanded, not blaming them but train cleanliness, and quality service are missing on today's Amtrak we really felt like lower class passengers."

Still sitting while I write up this review.I am counting the months when the new high-speed Brightline comes to Orlando. Amtrak will be a thing in the past."

They hit someone in Orlando which left the passengers wondering what was going on and how much of a delay it would be. We waited 3 hours they gave us a box lunch and not hot food.  We had to wait 2 hours for a conductor once we were suppose to leave Orlando.  I get it that conductors can only control a train so much hours, but why didn't they have this person waiting.  Once we got in West Palm we were told that we had to wait another 1 hour.  They had to turn the computer off and reboot by 12mid- I was support to arrive at my destination at 6pm I arrived at 1pm.

639,trustpilot.com,"We booked a room from San Francisco to Seattle which was supposed to depart at 8:50 PM and get in around the same time the next day. We were delayed almost 5 hours and when I asked if we should get a hotel rather than sleep in the train station I was given non-answers and no one apparently knew where the train was or when it would be moving. When I called customer service I was told I was out of line and entitled. When we finally arrived in Seattle around midnight we had fallen asleep and woke to someone yelling outside that they needed to get the train to the rail yard. No one knew we were on the train and we had to run off and leave some of our belongings behind. I have tried contacting their customer support several times with no response. About the train itself: The roomette area smelled like sewage and we had to walk through it every time we wanted to go to the dining car or the observation deck. I was expecting airplane food and I was still somehow even more disappointed. The staff got off the train and were throwing snowballs at the windows while we were stopped yet we were told we could not de-board for fresh air.Please save your time, money and sanity and find a different way to travel. We have family and friends who were excited to hear about our trip because they had planned on taking the same one, or similar, and luckily we have been able to talk them out of it with a quick synopsis of our terrible experience."
640,trustpilot.com,"Train 48/ leaving Chicago on 1-24 at  9:30pm. Getting on, an employee said to a lady next to me ""put your mask on or I'll kick you off the train. A little too aggressive I would think. This also was the only train I have been on where they did NO announcements such as emergency exits, bathrooms and times the cafe was open etc.  Seeing we had a 12 hour ride, we went to the lounge to have a few drinks and talk. We were the only ones in the enclosed lounge along with about 5-6 employees. Immediately felt we were not wanted by the employees with looks and facial expressions to each other and us. I started a small conversation here and there with the employees as they rolled their eyes and made small comments under their breath. Such as after I asked a question and it was answered, I would hear ""anyways.... accompanied by an eye roll. Another gentleman we did not know came to sit with us, he swore once, the male employee then stood up, positioned himself infront of our table, put his hand on his walky talky and in a very deep voice said ""watch the profanity"". He then sat back down. Mind you, he was about 2 feet away from us at his table. So his approach was uncalled for and threatening. The gentleman that was sitting with us apologized and there was no more profanity. At that point, we felt attacked and targeted. So we just kept to ourselves talking. I stood up to get a drink and when I came back I told my husband the time the lounge closed. The rude employee jumped in my conversation and said ""east coast time"" as rude as can be.  My husband was now upset, he turned and said ""your real ignorant"". At that point they all stood up ABRUPTLY, said ""here we go"" and  the employee said to my husband ""the next stop is yours"" it was well known they were just instigating and waiting to abuse some power. A moment later a lady came over to us after all employees were gone, also very aggressive. Instead of asking what the issue was, she told us that we were on her nerves because we were told about profanity and they all have had very long days. My husband asked her, on camera if she was the Amtrak police and she said yes!  I'm pretty sure that's illegal to misrepresent yourself as a police officer. Some back and forth conversation and then she left.  We have had a great ride the other 30 plus hours besides this specific ride and staff. This changed my mind on future traveling. Will not ever take amtrak train again!"

642,trustpilot.com,"We were on an Amtrak vacation to the Grand Canyon on October 16,2021.  The train broke down around 8:30 am somewhere in Indiana.  I overheard an Amtrak employee say, “this engine is a piece of garbage.”  Another employee told me the train should never have left Washington, DC…we boarded in Pittsburgh.  I called twice before we left on the trip to be sure I’d have a wheelchair waiting in Union Station to make our connection.  A new engine was hooked on to our train and we finally got into Union Station five hours late where no one was waiting to help me to our connecting train.  Finally a golf cart type vehicle showed up, but we missed our connection!    Amtrak did put us in a hotel in Chicago.  I finally got through to Amtrak Vacations who told me to just go home! Because we missed our connecting train, we lost all of our hotel, tour, and transportation reservations.  We left at midnight on Saturday, October 16, and I was back in Pittsburgh on Monday night, October 18.  The whole train experience was a nightmare.  Two of our foursome were handicapped, and our rights were violated causing us to miss our whole vacation!  I have filed a claim under the ADA.  I have been fighting for four months trying to get amtrak to refund the balance that was not covered by Amtrak Vacations.  In my opinion, never take a vacation on Amtrak!"

First due to inclement weather which I know they have no control over, my trip got cancelled and they turned the train back and dropped us off at the platform guy got picked up at almost 24 hours later! That's right I was on the train almost 24 hours waiting on them to figure out what in the hell they were going to do.Then I put in for my refund for my ticket which they said would take 3 to 7 days, 7 Days Rolls by and nothing from my bank about getting my refund. I called back and come to find out the customer service department associate didn't even open up the email for my request to start a case for my refund!!! That is completely and totally unacceptable and completely unprofessional. So I got a hold of a customer service representative who started the case File and said I should get it within 24 hours after the case has been opened up. Almost 3 days Rolls by and again crickets so I call back, the agent I spoke to said that I have been lied to from the get-go and it could take up to eight weeks to get my $64 back.....8.....weeks!!!!!!!I don't know what Amtrak is trying to pull but I am staying far away from them in the future and needless to say if they keep giving me the run-around I will be going to a lawyer about this and we'll be making it into a legal issue. Stay away from Amtrak!!!! Just drive yourself to your destination."

Only issue I have is there isn’t a lot of storage for larger luggage, but that’s more because my suitcase isn’t easily lifted onto the overhead storage. I’ve used them before, and I would use them again."

I had to take another train from LA to El Paso, it was Coach class and is nearly the same as business there’s no big difference. Some people from the crew where rude and annoyed when asking questions…they have big windows for the views but they are dirty and they don’t clean them. The restrooms are acceptable. I am 20 traveling alone and noticed it’s kinda dangerous being on the LA station at night, there is random people and saw a man with a gun screaming. The Amtrak isn’t also completely save because obviously they don’t check the baggage in the train station. Bring something to defend yourself if someone approaches and don’t leave your baggage alone when inside the train!"
646,trustpilot.com,"My family and I had the worst traveling experience ever. We were scheduled to leave New London 01/02/2022 but our train was canceled and rescheduled to leave 01/03/2022. We were able to travel from New London to DC for a layover that turned into a very chaotic situation. We arrived in DC from New London at 5:45pm scheduled to depart 7:24 going to Savannah GA our final destination. We sat in Union Station from 6:00pm until 8:45pm then we were boarded. However the train never departed the station so we began to worry wondering what’s happening. By now it’s 01/04/2022 at 1:30am and a Conductor finally appears with a Security guard and very rudely says this train isn’t going anywhere tonight, everyone has to get off… without any explanation. This is not an easy task because my mother is 96, one sister is wheelchair bound, the other has Parkinson’s, and my brother has a severe nerve disorder so all the transferring was stressful. It takes us 20mins to get back to the station with our luggage. We spent the night at the station now it’s unsure of what to expect. Later that morning around 6:30am another very rude employee walks through Union Station yelling that no Southbound trains will be leaving the station. That meant another day of cancellations so we had to find accommodations at our own expense with no explanation or consideration from Amtrak. I had to reach out to Amtrak to initiate our return home by calling reservations and holding on the phone for 3 hours! We were finally placed on a train to leave DC on 01/05/2022 however the Conductor let it be known that our boarding was an inconvenience to him and we would have to wait until after everyone boarded before my family could be seated. My husband and I had to sit in the food car before he put us in a seat only to be humiliated when a passenger approached us and said we were in her seat. Once again we were seated in the food car until we could be reseated. It wasn’t until we began talking to other passengers that we learned bad weather caused our trip from he!! My advice to Amtrak is to require its employees to go through sensitivity training and treat paying customers with respect! Without paying customers you wouldn’t have Engineers, Conductors, Customer Service Reps, etc. Do better Amtrak cause you lost these 6 customers forever!"

Even if you used  disinfectant  wipes you would use all just on sink. The floors and toilets were.  The room we were in was horrendous. It looked as if it wasn’t cleaned in years. The closet was five inches deep and one hanger and that was for four people. The staff was great but would never ride Amtrak again. Food was horrible. Even when ordered spaghetti and meatballs for kids it was mostaccioli which noodles were hard. Train ran little more then two hours late. I would not recommend anyone take this train."

651,trustpilot.com,"So train from WTN to PDX (Oregon), booking agent fails to get email correct so no e-tickets or precovid check, day of trip train arrives 2 hours 15 mins late this trip was with children so that sucked, then the arrival into PDX was almost 3 hours late and along that 24ish hour trek, there was no TP in multiple bathrooms, no sanitizing done at any point although masks are required and zero silverware or condiments in Cafe car. Employees without masks in lower levels on multiple occasions and overheard an employee talking about sleeping with the conductor last night at the stop at Spokane to another coworker. Ew, not professional...but wait it gets better. So the return trip to leave Saturday at 4:45 pm from PDX to return to WTN is canceled until Sunday due to weather, they refused to provide overnight accommodations so we get a cab and a hotel, but then we are informed that the train is now canceled until Tuesday so we get another night at the hotel...we are then informed that the train is now canceled until Thursday afternoon. All the while we are having to pay for our own hotel, food and cabs and when I call Amtrak to find out if there is any way to get a refund or discount I'm told they have to open a case and comment the issues so I get a case number through customer relations. I'm also told they cannot assess if a refund or voucher for future services will be allowed until the entire trip is complete, that at that point, when trip is complete I can then call to handle the case. Well, my husband now gets fired for not being back Monday so we cancel our tickets for the Thursday trip that would get us home Friday night, almost a week later than planned. We rent a car to drive back, in total out of pocket costs are totalling over $1,000 due to these canceled trains. Im understanding to a point about weather issues and that being out of human control but the whole experience was so messed up on so many levels. I call yesterday, which was a Sunday to deal with resolving the case and am told that customer relations is only open Mon-Fri that I must call back so I call today, Monday and am told they will not refund the tickets, mind you I'm not asking for compensation for the food, cab, hotel, car rental, just the train tickets but still get a no and that if I don't agree with the answer that I must then email corporate and wait for an email response as to whether they feel they should have to refund us. I'm so mad right now, I'm reviewing simply to inform people that if you get stuck they likely will not help you and you will be paying out of pocket for unexpected costs if you're stranded somewhere where you have no friends or family. Each time I called it was hours of waiting and when I did talk to someone I was hung up on multiple times even though I did not talk down to, curse at or be rude or talk over the agents. We experienced such unprofessional people during this trip and no one seemed to have any answers. Please be aware that their mask policy is ridiculous, you must wear one while sleeping too. We have taken this same trip probably around 15 times or so in the last 3 years and have never had such bad service or communication issues. We almost got stranded in a state 1200 miles away from our kids because they simply seemed to not care about their cargo, humans. We plan to get a lawyer, we are not standing for this."

653,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak Train Travel(Don’t waste your money)Chapter 1As a Christmas present to my wife, I decided to give her a train trip. We were to spend Christmas with my sister in Phoenix, Arizona. So instead of flying to Phoenix, we thought we would take a train to Phoenix, huge mistake. Not only did it cost more than three times the cost of an airline ticket, but it was the most grueling; stressful and trying travel experience we have ever had.It started in Memphis, Tennessee. This is where we boarded the City of New Orleans train bound for Chicago, where we were to make a connection to board the Texas Eagle bound for Phoenix. Well, the City of New Orleans train arrived two hours late. We were to depart Memphis at 9:40 pm but didn’t depart until 11:40 pm. In addition to being late, our bedroom in the sleeper car was the size of a closet. The attendants had stuffed towels between bulkheads to prevent them from rattling. Plus, another warning that I am going to clue you in on, that Amtrak never mentions is, train horn noise! Every time the train enters an intersection where the train intersect a street; road; highway, it will sound its horn for 15 seconds before entering that intersection.  So, the thought that you will be falling to sleep to the clickety-clack of the train moving down the track, is nothing more than an illusion. Now, for another illusion, the great food image aboard a train is just more “smoke & Mirrors” sold to you by Amtrak. Instead of the food promised at a lovely table, we were served microwaved food in either cardboard or plastic container, that was a step below hospital food. If you are considering a train trip, I would say “DON’T DO IT”!!"
654,trustpilot.com,"I never write reviews…. This topped it off though. I will no longer be supporting Amtrak.

660,trustpilot.com,"This was my first time experiencing Amtrak.I was already aware of delays being common, so I set my depart date a full day before. I hoped it wouldn't go nightmare scenario where it's cancelled without refund & I have to drive anyway, or end up stuck somehow. & I [hate] driving.Fortunately, Amtrak is not that low.I had to modify my trip, but because it was so close, I needed an agent. The automated system gave me an estimated wait time of ~1hr & provided a callback option, but I missed it. It only gives 1 opportunity to accept the callback option, & never again throughout the hold time. Seeing other reviews of the customer service line, this may have been relatively fortunate, as they stated that agents could [never] call back.So I waited...for ~3.5hrs...just to get an agent...after the automated system told me it was only a ~1hr wait.Went fairly smoothly. The agent sounded like they were dead inside, but fortunately, they were quick, polite, & weren't rude otherwise.(Continued)The first half of my trip was smooth. Got to my destination at the expected time. Seeing as this was during holidays, the trip was actually shorter than driving would have been. Coach is only slightly more expensive than the gas needed. The reduced stress is a boon & makes up the price difference. Though  considering European & Asian railways... it should be cheaper.On my way back, I was on a, possibly [the], southbound train that was caught by the winter storm on the east coast. This was Jan 3, 2021.I-95 had a super pileup of shipping trucks. So considering that, the train was still leagues better.The snowfall was heavy enough to down trees & block the tracks. We were stuck on the train for almost 24hrs. We had a moment, ~1.5hr, where the train was powered down. So no heat, while it was freezing outside. Fortunately, authorities came to order Amtrak to move us back to our starting locations.Minus 1 star to Amtrak for that, shouldn't have needed to be told.Minus 2 more stars for letting us all be cold. I'd hate to consider how much longer they'd let us steadily freeze had there not been orders from above.We all got transfers at least. No charge. Delay time was 2 days. Train cars were packed from Amtrak trying to catch up.As for blocked railways causing that delay, Amtrak doesn't maintain them. It's not within their scope.Maintaining the railways is mostly under stewardship of CSX (Chessie Seaboard Multiplier).Much like a suburban firebreak, railroads need the tree line cut back to prevent wood debris falling in the way. One prevents your house burning. The other keeps trains running without derailment or other damage & stoppage.During both my away & return trips, I noticed that, for most of the distance, the trees were 5-10 paces away. That's not acceptable.Again, this is a CSX responsibility. [Not] Amtrak.I can't give an Amtrak a minus for that.Good news, the stress was still less than driving, & I got home safe. Would ride again, if only because driving is a -50 stars in my view. Barely a compliment.I recommend airlines if anyone hates trains that much. Because even with electric vehicles, the stress itself is still cancer. Vehicle automation is also a waste of resources."

When I got to the door the conductor put his key in the door closer and shut the door while I was standing there. I pleaded to open the door, that I just drove one hour and need to get to NY. Coldly, he shook his head no and the train started to move slowly forward. I was shocked at this callous behavior of an Amtrak employee. Years back a conductor would have been happy to help a person. Today they are stoic, angry, cold people employed by this company. Where is the humanity in people today? Karma will do it's job for this man. Amtrak... you should be ashamed at reading this account of your employees behavior."
662,trustpilot.com,"Awfully dirty roomette! There's black and brown stuff on the vent and upholstery on the ceiling right by your face when you're in the bed. I got sniffles trying to sleep. Stains on curtains, hair on an unfolded blanket makes me think no one cleaned the room between people. I don't see an option to add media but I have videos of wiping a clean white towels on the upholstery surfaces and it coming away with black (not dust, BLACK) on it each time. Their cleaning regimen needs to at least include wiping *all* surfaces with disinfectant or mold control or something! Especially the places faces will be. For the price I honestly should've just flown but I thought I was getting a relaxing, scenic train experience.Food is just frozen packaged stuff they microwave."
663,trustpilot.com,"The workers are nice people. All very helpful. Train was comfortable enough since there wasn’t many people traveling. However, the first train was 4 hours and 40 minutes late. I got the text notifications almost 12 hours AFTER the train was originally scheduled to leave. Then the app gave me the train station address which I shared to be picked up. And it was actually 1.2 miles away from where I was dropped off. All around not a great experience and will most likely just fly next time."

665,trustpilot.com,"Crescent line from Atlanta to Alexandri, Va. ... 1st: Atlanta station is a DUMP!  2nd: Train arrives 40 min. Late (after midnight).  3rd: Sorry food.  4th:  I arrived for lunch at 11:40am (Advertised 11:30 start), and was told that attendant would visit my room and bring lunch)...  The attendant arrived at 12:30 to take order but did not bring food until 1:40.. I refused because my station arrived at  1:50pm...SAD!  You pay $375 and can't even get a bad lunch!!   5th:  MOST IMPORTANTLY...  The employees show no energy, passion, or attempt to assist the passengers.  They sit around and seem to just wait for their abusive pension system!!    I WILL NOT USE AMTRAK AG@AN!!"
666,trustpilot.com,My train got cancelled and they did not give me a refund. My coach ticket was refundable and when I called up and choose to have the company call me back they never did. I did call back multiple times but I never got ahold of a representative. It is unprofessional and they do not seem to intend to refund my money for a train that they cancelled. This is ridiculous as the ticket was $30 and it was never used it.
667,trustpilot.com,Why would anyone travel by rail? Probably the worst mode of travel in the World other than Europe We've traveled from Saratoga to Jacksonville NC made 17 stops on the way to NYC then had to go across town through Garbage - Bums & Gangs to get to Penn Station then made 49 stops between NYC & Jacksonville NC total time of trip 27 hours Does anyone want to do this when flying out of Albany airport with transfer at Charlotte NC total time 4hrs to Jacksonville NCAmtrak has got to be the WORST and Friends this is NO exaggeration or lie this is the straight truth & booking early gets you a a air price cheaper than the Train think of this as a Sage Advise looking out for your interest
668,trustpilot.com,"This is the absolute worst travel experience I’ve ever had. Not only was my first train delayed by two and a half hours, and I was on my second train for two and a half hours longer than was scheduled, but the employees are terrible. They don’t communicate anything with you at all or help you in any way. I saw countless people press their help button and not one time did an employee come to help them. This is something that i would not recommend to anyone looking to travel efficiently."
669,trustpilot.com,"I’m currently still sitting on my train at 2:29 AM, despite the fact that my time of arrival was 11:49 PM. With this train comes constant delays that the staff gives little to no information about. By the time I finally get home, it will be about 4 hours after I was originally supposed to. Highly recommend another form of travel."
670,trustpilot.com,This was my first time Riding Amtrak a long time and then I have a good experience I was squish the whole ride and think they need to make more seating for larger people so people like me who sit with them won’t be squish the whole train ride
671,trustpilot.com,"My husband and I rode the California Zephyr from Chicago to San Francisco, leaving on Oct 24, 2021.  We paid a little more than $2,000 for the experience, riding in a sleeper car.  While the train ride and scenery were terrific, we were thoroughly disgusted by how filthy the cars were!  I don't know that anyone vacuumed our room and the bathroom was disgusting.  Every piece of window, mirror, glass was covered in fingerprints.  The carpets were filthy.  Even the windows in the Observation Car were disgusting.  It took a lot of fun out of an expensive ride.  Would not pay for that again.  On the bright side, our purser/car attendent was kind and helpful, and the meals in the restaurant car were good."
672,trustpilot.com,If you want to have a miserable ride then take the Amtrak. Supposed to arrive at 9 am currently sitting standstill waiting for the crew to switch because they can’t work over 12 hours. It’s currently 11 am and they haven’t made an announcement yet. All it’s been was delay delay delay. Been Sitting here for 40 minutes waiting for crew change. Long story short don’t take this it’s garbage.
673,trustpilot.com,"Took the 5 California Zephyr. The views, which have been there for a while now, are still spectacular. Everything else is a different story. My god, Amtrak is in a sad state. Got a roomette because there was no observation car. How is this possible on your most scenic route? I dont want to focus too much on the specific employees of my specific train because clearly with the reviews, it’s a management and systematic issue so consider this a review of the car attendant and not my car attendant. But here goes… My room was disgusting. I found loose pills on the floor, the seats smelled like BO, and there was nasty dust everywhere, Any kind of non upward facing flat surface was dirty. My car attendant was one of the rudest people I’ve eve had to interact with. And thats the problem, you have to interact with them. If they hate their job cause their job sucks then fine, but part of the roomette system is that you must interact with the attendant. You have to order food through them and have them take your garbage, and they come by to do “turn down” everyday. I literally was anxious about even ordering my meals because I had to interact with my car attendant. So you pay for the bed and nice rooms, but know that an additional cost, is that you’ll be more polite than the people you’re paying to be your hosts. You basically have to be rude. It’s the least professional experience I’ve ever had. I asked for a menu and he literally rolled his eyes at me. Every single meal he got wrong, always bringing me less than what I ordered. Never once came by to see if I needed anything or if the meals were wrong. I didnt even bother saying anything because it was such a chore. Forget whether or not I’m a customer and he’s in the hospitality field, he didn’t even treat me like a human. I was a pest. An annoyance. I said thank you after every interaction and he never once said you’re welcome. They act like because they call you sir, that they aren’t insulting you to your face. He just turned his back, grunted, and left. I’d literally rather pay more money to not have a car attendant at all. Im sure the job sucks, and the employees act accordingly, so just cut it and let us order our own meals and not be treated like an unwelcome intruder. I just want the views and the bed, I dont want to have to stay in someone’s house that hates me."
674,trustpilot.com,"Worse experience of my life.  My family and I were traveling from Freeport Maine to Boston for a full day. Staff on train were rude, bus showed up at station to transport us partially due to track repairs.  Then when we got to Boston I received a phone call stating the return train was CANCELLED!! The last train home would be at 5 pm (we were scheduled to leave at 10:30 pm and had non-refundable reservations for events).  I went to the train station and they did not even know that the 2 evening/night trains were canceled.  They offered to switch my train to the 5:10 on or next day.  Was told I could not get a refund but could reschedule- given the rudeness and poor service we ended up spending money to take the bus home from Boston to Portland and find a ride to Freeport. The bus was an hour faster because there were no stops, was clean and relaxing. My return train had already been rescheduled from 10:30 - 11:45 then back to 10:30 all within a few weeks.   I will never use Amtrak again, I will take my own vehicle.  Not customer service oriented."
675,trustpilot.com,"I called to make my reservation over the phone because the credit card server was down. It took like 12 minutes to complete the automated ticket purchase, which was actually relatively smooth, to give them credit. Then, at the end of the call, after I had paid and everything, the robot lady told me she was sending me to A REAL PERSON SO I COULD GIVE THEM MY EMAIL FOR THE E-TICKET. I WAITED MORE THAN 50 MINUTES ON HOLD BEFORE I HUNG UP. OH MY GOD. WHY COULDN'T THEIR AUTOMATED SYSTEM TAKE THE EMAIL?!?!! WHY WOULDN'T THEY JUST SAY TO GET THE APP?!?!?!!?!?!? I'M SO ANGRY!!!!!"
676,trustpilot.com,"So my Mother and I were going to take a train from South Bend to Phoenix.  Thought it would be a great opportunity to spend some time together and be a picturesque adventure.  Well my Mom does not like to use her card online so she calls Amtrak to purchase her ticket.  At that time she was informed that we would be on the train from South Bend to Chicago then hours later, possibly overnight,  we would take a bus from Chicago to Flagstaff and spend one or possibly two nights then take a train to I foget where then transfer to a bus to Sky Harbor.  Ah is it me or is that a bus ride not a train.  LISTEN UP AMTRAK!  GET WITH IT!  YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE STRONGER THAN EVER!  AIRLINES ARE OVERWHELMED AND SUCK.  YOU COULD GRAB THE BALL AND MAKE BILLIONS.  AND IF YOU DO REMEMBER ME WITH VOUCHERS!"
677,trustpilot.com,"Left from the Houston, TX Amtrak station and the train was 2/3 hours late. Johnny who handles ticketing, baggage, loading and mad customers did an excellent  job. He was from behind his booth working with everyone keeping us updated and what were the problems. So happy he was there otherwise this would be a 1 star review."
678,trustpilot.com,Train was supposed to arrive at 11:48 and now apparently will come at 12:22. Some next level bs.
679,trustpilot.com,"In late July, 2021, my husband and I traveled from New Orleans to Memphis and back via the City of New Orleans (train.) I brought antibacterial wipes and used them on all surfaces we would touch in our roomettes. I was shocked by the amount of actual black grime picked up by the wipes. Amtrak's claim to be ""utilizing EPA-registered cleaning products and enhancing cleaning on commonly used surfaces"" is a whole lie.Aside from this, the staff was amazing and our trip was enjoyable. I have two observations:1. If we choose to eat in the dining car instead of our roomette, we have to stagger and stumble our way through a turbulent train, gripping and touching all surfaces to steady ourselves from car to car. Given that we are still in a pandemic, it would be prudent to include single-use antibacterial hand wipes.2. By design and name, it is expected that passengers in the sightseer lounges are watching the scenery.  I understand staffing and resources are constant issues across all industries. However, all of the windows on our observation car were visibly filthy, hindering our enjoyment of the view."
680,trustpilot.com,"The train was an hour late only for it to constantly stop for a good while. It got to the point that it was way off schedule and decided to just stop minutes away from Union Station. It's also the same crew every Friday that the train is late and rude. When people kept asking about what's going on they were just saying ""they're on their way just sit down."" I hope someone decides to fix this or get a better crew to deal with this sort of stuff and just people who need the job to get by."
681,trustpilot.com,I wouldn’t even give one star if I were able. If you want to cancel your trip for medical reasons they require a “doctors excuse” from your doctor saying you can’t travel. No wonder nobody uses the train anymore.  My agents name is Ben in customer service. Call him.
682,trustpilot.com,"Absolute worst travel experience of my life. Trying to get from Los Angeles back home to Indiana has been a f****** nightmare, first a FIVE HOUR DELAY then another 3 on Barstow, CA. Rude staff very over priced food.

How hard would it be to have salads, tuna sandwiches, hard boiled eggs or a scrambled bowl? I feel like I am on The ""Snow Piercer' train.  Now the microwave food is not available and we get to go hungry for dinner and all night because they can't ring us up. I guess this is my punishment for asking for food. Not even a cracker was offered. I only have 24 more hours of a 3 day trip. Now they say they'll take cash. Too bad I have none nor do they have an atm. Good thing I paid $300 for such a lovely time."

I don't make that kind of money but had already purchased tickets to Aladdin, never again!"

688,trustpilot.com,"I went on a 17 hour trip with my family which Involved having to move from train to train and each and every single Amtrak employee on the train was beyond rude to my family and myself. I have elders with me who can’t hear well and we were being yelled out and told the entire trainwas messed up because they accidentally sat in the wrong seat. At one point earlier in the trip on the way in, another employee, Tracy H. told us we could “handle this outside.” I understand that the employees might be tired, but itdoesn’t give them the right to belittle the passengers and ruin their experience. Safe to say we will no longer be traveling with Amtrak."

I know I won't be taking a train ever again after a 10 hour delay."

I know I did because the site made me confirm each one but still I was given coach for two out of the three trains. When I informed the ticket counter of this issue they said that we don't have a business class. 🙄. The bathrooms were filthy and in some cases not operational. The staff is rude and condescending. And now finally after 52 hours of travel I have to sit at my destination station and wait 2 hours for my checked bags to arrive.. let's go through this again, you scammed me for extra money on the ticket, treated me like a second class traveler and are now wasting my time further."
694,trustpilot.com,"After a 2 hour 17 minute hold for a customer service rep, an agent finally picked up. Then he asked if he could put me on hold again to be able to answer my very basic question. Another 15 minute hold, then I received an automated message stating that amtrak is now closed at 8pm and the phone line cut off. The agent also had my number yet never called back after the cutoff time. Nightmare service."
695,trustpilot.com,"Recently took a trip from Indianapolis to St Paul and had a great time. Seating was roomy and comfortable (especially in comparison to the airplane I took to get down there) and I had all the things on the train I needed. The scenery really made the trip special as well and I really loved the big windows to look out of. No complaints even though the train was late (all forms of transportation will arrive late sometimes). I would suggest a higher standard of sandwiches which I would gladly pay for, but otherwise I will be more than happy to board Amtrak again."

Wait time for customer service in calls was over an hour. Reps were rude and uninformative. My coastal starlight was delayed... First of all, they emailed me about it how archaic is that? Secondly the reps at the train station couldn't get me an estimate about when the train was coming. Amtrak sucks"
699,trustpilot.com,I was on the am track from wish ram WA to Spokane WA. The train rattled and jumped horribly stopped at Pasco for 10 minutes and was still 45 minutes early to Spokane I wonder how fast did this train go to get there so fast. Took it home an it was the most uncomfortable ride the seats were like siting on a bare board with no cushion . It rattled and jumped an after hearing about that train derailment I will never ride it again. I like my safety too much and it felt like I was in a tin can.
700,trustpilot.com,"Mr. Chris Lavander, an Amtrac representative at the Lorton Station in Virginia over heard my 88 year old mother tell me she could just lean against the cart while we wait 30 minutes until we could board the train and we had just gotten all the way out to our car and there was no seating left. Although my mom is a warrior that would not have been possible on her best day, Chris yelled over and said he would get her a folding chair and he took of going all the way back to the station and back almost to fast to be humanly possible revealing he was an angel. I wasn't surprised when I found out he was a veteran, a Navy Seabee. Mr. Lavander I salute you you made our trip may you be blessed as you have blessed us you our in our prayers. I hope Amtrak is taking care of this man people like him are a blessing to us all. Thank you again Sir."
701,trustpilot.com,"The food was great , our attendant was good ,our roomette was made for midgets .if amtrak would make the roomettes bigger it might be worth going. , we pay big bucks and have to sit in a 4 x 7 room for 2 days , no leg room , no beverage holders , everything slides off the shiny smooth tabletop ,lost our drinks at least 10 times , you have a 12 inch area to climb up on the top bunk, virtually no air conditioning ,sweated the whole time on the train , my wife went and took a shower and as soon as she was finished soaping up there was no more water in the shower. Baggage service is almost non existent . Tried to upgrade to a bigger room and $350 wasnt enough for amtrak considering that 1/2 of all the rooms were not even occupied, you would think that they wouldnt mind since they are empty and we are stuck playing twister in a roomette.,whoever runs this company should find another job because he definitely doesnt make good company decisions…;….."
702,trustpilot.com,Never again. Train conductor KB and  other employees on Spokane to Chicago train need to be fired.Abuse of authority. Train rattled horribly. Thought we were going to crash. Told attendant that the train felt unsafe as it rattled and leaned heavily on curves. He laughed at me. Train did crash on the way back to Montana. Wasted over $700 to be treated with complete disrespect and was completely unsafe.
703,trustpilot.com,I booked an Amtrak ticket from Anna Illinois to Chicago Illinois this last weekend to return home from a funeral. After taking Greyhound for my trip there which was actually from Rockford to Nashville I had decided I Wasn't taking Greyhound back home.....It was horrible! I had never taken Amtrak train and was nervous but it was a Great TRIP.......Great Customer Service. The works on the train were very helpful answering my questions and let me know which stop I could jump out and smoke a VERY Quick cigarette which I TRULY appreciated!!! I never tried the food on the train I had grabbed a sandwich from a close by jimmy John's before boarding and ate it on the train. It was a bit creepy along parts of the ride like seeing the car in front and backing swaying on the tracks. but overall it was a Great Ride. Very spacious! Super Comfy! I actually got some sleep finally!!!! I Really Enjoyed My First Ride in Amtrak and will ride again!!!!
704,trustpilot.com,I repeat.. I will not ride Amtrak ever again long distance!!! Im going to put a review down this is a hell trip! My trip was one way from San Francisco to Seattle after my run in San Francisco.I spoken with so called supervisor agent they will not provide me a hotel or pay for my lyft. They are lucky that I have extra funds to spend... Oh yes not really extra funds but the what the hell 50.00!! I'm nervous as hell taking lyft from Amtrak to my apartment. I asked to stay in the station for 4 hours till my bus comes. They closed the door as soon as you get your bags from the station. I was going to ride Amtrak through national parks next year I don't think so. Hell I might cancel my trip to Portland for next weekend that they may loose a customer. Pissed pissed pissed pissed pissed off.. I'm thankful I am not working with them. I thought they are a good employer with respecting service. I guess not. I can go on an on with this.My arrival time was 7:30pm an got to 1:30am. It was horrible of riding that many hours with a mask.
705,trustpilot.com,"Received an abrupt email about my reservation being changed. The email also stated ""you don't need to do anything, we've taken care of it, but if you have any questions, call us"". I checked the website and the same original reservation showed up.I called and was told that the wait is about 90 minutes. I picked the callback option and received a call about 2 hours later. For some reason, when I received the call back, I was placed on hold for another 20 minutes until I was speaking to a rep who was not at all helpful and extremely slow in responding to any questions. That phone call took another half an hour just for him to tell me that the ticket was indeed changed because he was so slow to respond. He told me to just show up to the station as my original ticket showed, until I asked ""but the new ticket has a different departure time?""By the way, the new itinerary has 2 stops including an 8-minute transfer to a bus. The original ticket was non-stop. I would not have booked had I known I would have to transfer twice."
706,trustpilot.com,"This was easily one of the worst travel experiences of my life. I’ve traveled on spirit air and that was LUXURY compared to my recent trip on Amtrak Downeaster. The train stopped in Haverhill and forced us to take a bus to Boston for 45 minutes. That would have been fine but on the way back, we arrived 45 minutes early to Enid’s we could at least sit near each other, just to have to bus we were ready to board suddenly pull away from us and refuse to let us board, forcing us to board a bus multiple rows away from us and our children for OVER AN HOUR back to the first stop on the train. On top of that, the drivers excuse for traffic back to the station (the entire reason for taking the train in the first place) was “well most of you are probably drunk anyway so ‘enjoy the ride’”. Needless to say I wond be using Amtrak again in the future when I can take the MTBA from 15 extra minutes away for 1/3 the price and without the enormous headache and inconvenience."
707,trustpilot.com,I purchased a one way Amtrak ticket from Raleigh to New Haven. I had a one way flight back the next day. The Amtrak was leaving 8:45 am -9:40 pm. My wife drops me off there and they never text me but tells me the train is delayed 2 hours. The worst is I miss my connecting train and will have to wait in D.C. for 6 hours arriving in New Haven at 5:00 am. I ask do you have some sort of lounging for me and they said no only for business class. I say you screwed up the timing you should make mine a business class. They say I have to ask them in D.C. but there are plenty places to eat. I say for 6 hours! I'm not going to wait until I get to D.C. to find out. Luckily I found a flight to Conneticut and got a refund but loss money on the flight.

I got through once and Melissa put me on hold and then all of sudden I’m on a survey line asking how would rate my reservation experience? Why didn’t Melissa call me back? Are you kidding me? Almost five hours I’ve been on the phone. Nobody has provided a solution for us. You watch tomorrow when we show up, i will upset yet will be treated rudely because how dare I question them? This is quite an awful ending to our journey. I used to love Amtrak. Never again. Plus the music drives one insane. It scratchy and worse that the old elevator music they used to play in the 1970s. Five hours of it! Now it’s 10:12 PM and still on hold. Yet, every five minutes, passengers are threatened with the mask mandate and how you’ll be thrown off the train."
709,trustpilot.com,I’d give zero stars if I could. I had booked a ride on 9/3 for a train on 9/17 and just today (9/16) got a message saying the train had been cancelled. I called to talk to an agent and turned out there was railroad service planned for the whole weekend since 9/8 and notices were sent out today. A refund was never offered until I gave the call.

711,trustpilot.com,"I'll preface this review by saying that I think most of the issues with Amtrak are the fault of the government and lack of adequate funding. But they sure need to find nicer employees too. The quality of service continues to decline year after year, especially on long-distance trains. Maybe the service on the northeast corridor trains is great; I have seldom traveled on those. I get the feeling that the long-distance routes subsidize the northeast corridor trains, which if true, is so unfair. It seems like the D.C. based federal government (politicians and employees) wants to get rid of the national Amtrak network and just have their fancy new high-speed trains for their convenience in the northeast.I've taken many trips on Amtrak over the years, both short and cross country. Unless you're a train nut and/or hate/afraid of flying, do not use Amtrak. There are a few good/nice Amtrak employees, but most are surly, unprofessional, or downright mean. The bad experience starts with their website. It's impossible to plan a multi-stop, long-distance trip on the website. So, unfortunately one must get a reservations agent on the phone, which takes FOREVER. When one finally answers, they are very rude and impatient. I've even been scolded because I didn't understand their wacky website. IF you pursue this misadventure further and actually board a train, you'll most likely be riding on ancient passenger cars staffed by yet more angry, bitter, unprofessional, surly, and power-mad employees. The passenger cars' HVAC systems are ancient as well and can't make use of HEPA filters (to rid the air of covid). Mask wearing is enforced only sporadically. None of the windows open (not even an inch), even in the private rooms. The food is HORRIBLE and is served on/in plastic which is NOT biodegradable I'd bet. There are frequent disruptions and late trains. I and my friends have experienced waits ranging from three to 20+ hours! And Amtrak does not keep you informed about these disruptions. You'll be sitting there (sometimes literally) in the dark in some remote area with no bathroom or anything to eat or drink. To sum up, Amtrak is only a good idea for rail fans and people who don't fly and MUST get someplace and can't drive."
712,trustpilot.com,Capital Limited has an awesome team. This crew is amazing at accommodating the passengers. Excellent service with smiling faces were aboard my train. Thank you so much for making our train ride great today. Special thanks to Robert Jones Jr for his extra care with his passengers.

The conductors are liars, the time frame is skewed in a horrific manner, the food is the cheapest quality for top dollar prices and 14 hours is WAAAAY too long to keep someone cramped in a train seat that only reclines about 25 degrees. Awful awful awful"
714,trustpilot.com,"The problem for Amtrak in September , 2021 is that their long distance sleeper cars are old and should have been replaced years ago. Some the controls in the sleeper do not work. The ventilation in my car was poor. Someone broke the rules and had a smoke in the downstairs bathroom. Soon the entire car could smell it, even if you had your door shut. The shower room below had a slow drain and soon the water had piled up an inch deep. I had to stop showering before I was even half done. These old cars are grimy and not well maintained. So I have a problem with the aging equipment which is slowly being replaced with new cars. Wait a year or two before you book a sleeper roomette. The crew tries to give good service but the old cars and trackage work against them. They need more staff."
715,trustpilot.com,"This was the worst experience I have ever had travelling. First and last time taking a train. We were onboard for 3 days with no A/C, the attendants were rude, horrible and all acted like they hated their jobs. The intercom didn't work and we told the crew and they didn't care we missed all the announcements and were completely left in the dark about states and stops. On top of that there was no food because they ran out of everything or the employees would get to the food 1st. I would not recommend this service to anyone!!!"
716,trustpilot.com,"A huge reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because of the fact their trains don't have wifi for long haul rides. Just short haul. It's insane to have to sit there 12 hours. Another reason was cause coach couldn't use the dining car. Cause of covid they only let the sleeper car passengers use it. Give me a break. They sitting people next to each other on the train, strangers yet wouldn't let us use the dining car where we would be sat at tables. All in all it was a nice ride, people were nice and once we got the seating straight and I got to sit next to my friend. I was happy."
717,trustpilot.com,"I have no problem with the train rides themselves, but the website is archaic. I can't buy tickets for anyone with a different last name than me, which while perhaps unintentional, is sexist. You can't buy tickets for your partner with another last name, kids, sisters, etc. Very uncool. The option to ""modify the traveller"" is also misleading. You cannot transfer the ticket to another person; you must cancel the reservation and have the other person repurchase. Additionally, it's annoying that you can't pay with a combination of money and rewards points; you need to have enough points to make an entire purchase (unless some way to apply after the fact?). These issues (especially diff last names) need to be fixed ASAP."
718,trustpilot.com,3 hours 29 min on hold on 9/3/21 Amtrak sucks!!!!
719,trustpilot.com,"For such a Mega rail line, Amtrak should just close shop. I’m done with them. What a HORRIBLE experience. Nasty conductors, every seat leaked (even in biz class) and they can’t even handle a rain storm. Stranded for hours. No thanks, I’ll fly next time. Later Amtrak"
720,trustpilot.com,My experience was disgusting. I was sexually assaulted on the train and I didn't even get an apology from the crew. Everything was handled with no regard for the victim.
721,trustpilot.com,Waited 1 hour on the phone to speak to anyone and the phone operator was extremely rude to me and ended the call at my face without doing anything yo help me.
722,trustpilot.com,"Waiting for Amtrak connecting bus more than 40 minutes!? Not reliable, I will never ise it again"
723,trustpilot.com,"In general, very bad experience, the coach section is very cold at night, the dining room does not service food.  it's for sleepers only. My train was 5.hours late than schedule. Don't recommend it."
724,trustpilot.com,I will never take Amtrak ever again in my life. Coming from New York my train was 2 1/2 hours late I missed my ride to North Station which made me in return missed my train you cannot call customer service because they do not pick up the phone I have been sleeping outside in Boston waiting for the  station to open Absolutely no regard for their customers whatsoever I have never been so disgusted in my life. This is the worst travel experience in my entire life again I will never take Amtrak for as long as I live. The most unprofessional outfit I’ve ever came across Greyhound makes these people look like a Toyota compared to a Ferrari. Never again if I could give a negative star I would
725,trustpilot.com,Took a trip on Starlight 11 from Eugene to Los Angeles. Had the best experience ever. Train assistant Talía Shapiro. She went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and content. Any questions we had she answered and was so helpful in every way. Great attitude!! Very professional and kind. 👍🏼
726,trustpilot.com,"Actually terrible..tells me train departs at 5:30 A.M...doesnt come for 5 hours. Really? Thanks for wasting my entire day..really bad, just really poor everything..my biggest question is how come were always stopping because something's wrong or the schedules are constentaly getting switched up so everyone has to find a diffrent route...take your money and mostly your time somewhere else, dont bring any service to amtrak."
727,trustpilot.com,"The Amtrak Website misrepresents their policy for Covid schedule changes. When making the booking they claim no charges for changes to the schedule. However they have no way to do any change other than an e-voucher. Amtrak sent a voucher for only 75% of the ticket price. Nowhere in phone menu or online does it say you pay a 25% penally. On the contrary, their website stated ""Amtrak is waiving all change fees for reservations made by January 4, 2022""A dishonest organization with no accountability. Better fly or drive."
728,trustpilot.com,You guys need to do better and especially with ya phone service i have tried to reach a agent for over 3 weeks about my refund everytime i call im on hold for 2 to 3 hours and still dont get to talk to anyone this is really sad you expect me to pay that amount of money for a trip and nothings right its packed on the train people standing up until someone gets off then they can sit down you guys dont need the money that bad that is ridiculous why are yall packing the train like that knowing its still covid smh the worst service ever yall need to get it together
729,trustpilot.com,"This is the most spectacularly incompetent organization I have ever seen. My teenage daughter was supposed to have a simple train trip from Iowa to Michigan to go back to college. In the car it is seven hours, by Amtrak it is supposed to take 11 hours. It has now turned into a nightmare experience for her traveling alone today. First the train was 2 1/2 hours late to leave, with of course no prior notice. She was too late to catch her connecting train in Chicago, and although the company told us the connecting train would probably wait for the passengers the train left. We were told that if this occurred they would charter a bus to take the passengers the rest of the way to Michigan. Nope. My daughter is now being told that she is being given a hotel voucher and that she is on her own to take a cab ride at her own expense to the hotel which is 20 minutes away. She then has to take another cab ride back to the train station tomorrow for another several hour train trip to her final destination. While all this was going on, of course we spent hours on the phone trying to get through customer service, which was a very little help. Don’t ever, repeat ever, do business with Amtrak. Absolutely infuriating experience with these incompetent bozos."
730,trustpilot.com,"The worst people ever! Do you guys have common sense when train moved and still there people helping their family with luggage???? My brother had to jump out of moving train in Newport News and scratched his both arms and legs cos train first of all was late, and he helped me to get my bag inside as I had my kid sleeping in my hands. You guys do not know anything about customer service! Terrible workers of Amtrak, wish u the worst job than you have. And the girl whatever her name kicked us from disabled sit to find any other available, she wasted our time.  Never ever deserve even to think to buy tickets for those trains."
731,trustpilot.com,"There were six of us from Indy, traveling Amtrak from Chicago to Glacier National Park. We purchased our vacation from Amtrak vacations, who is not owned by Amtrak. The Chicago culture is not as friendly as most places, but the Amtrak people in Chi-town were just downright mean and had some serious control issues. UP AGAINST THE WALL, one man spitting his words to several of us in line pointing, so a slow moving cart could come around the corner. The woman in the Metro Lounge was just as nasty, not so much as giving their guests eye contact. Spouting the rules and regs to park your luggage in the undersized closet. By God you aren’t getting your luggage back if you don't have your green ticket. Every single Union station worker was on this power trip. One of our six is a petite 55 year old woman who asked for help with her bag to get onto the train 1000’ down the track. By the time the conversation was over, she was in tears. Less hassle than the airlines? I think not. Once we were on the train, the 🧑‍✈️ was very welcoming and helpful. The car and roomette was worn and grimy but oh well at least we felt welcome. It wasn’t long before the subject of meals came up. The 👩‍✈️ ask if we want 5pm or 6:45. We chose the later and finally by 9pm they allowed us in the dining car. The meal was as good as train food can be and the folks serving it up worked hard. I assume they were short handed because this is what they repeatedly told us on the way out and back.  The 👩‍✈️ Made up our beds for us (dont forget to tip) and I slept in the upper while my wife had the lower. Not the best night sleep I ever had, its a train…but at 3am I awoke with 16 bed bug bites. My buddy across the hall had two. My RN wife and buddy didn’t believe me that it was bedbugs. Two days later in Glacier we met a Nurse Practioner who had the same problem and went to an after hours clinic. They confirmed it was indeed bed bugs. Yikes! Hey, it happens, right? I bet it would happen less if they would vacuum and clean. I notified the conductor  and as he shook his head in a not again sort of way, assured me that the car would be taken out of service and fumigated. Not sure if that included cleaning. The conductor handed me an incident report and gave me a look like don’t let the door hit you on the butt. The fine people from all over the US working the short summer at the park were well trained and downright helpful in every way. With every problem a response was heard from them, you are with Amtrak vacations? They knew of their shortcoming and the work arounds to fix them.I wont go into all of the screw-ups that this disorganized company made, but there were plenty including over charging and canceling excursions at the last minute. Want to talk with someone on the phone. Get ready to sit for an hour and wait.The trip out thru the plains was mildly interesting if you are the sort of person who can find beauty in anything. The trip back was the same in reverse. Then return to the cow lines in Union Station with their dogs barking at our heals. When people ask how my trip was I ask them if they remember the Chevy Chase vacation movies? Oh, one more thing, a week or two after retuning home a fat letter came from Amtrak. At last an apology or maybe 10% off a ticket or two. Nope, a letter stating if you want to make a claim (reimbusrement for medical) fill out these 80 forms and be sure to give us you SS#, insurance company name, sign this disclaimer etc, Yeah, I’m goin‘ do that."
732,trustpilot.com,"DO NOT TRUST THE WEBSITE WHEN IT SAYS REFUNDABLE.  Purchase your ticket only if you decide to leave through Am Trak for sure, if not sure, find another source of transportation.  First they make you wait on the phone until you almost quit, and then they sneak in “cancellation fees”.  I can understand if you decide to quit last minute, but 3 days before, wow!  This company sucks!"
733,trustpilot.com,"Almost always late. Not uncommon for it to be several hours late. And for some reason the refuse to provide ANY info or transparency on why they're late or to provide any realistic idea of when the train might arrive via text. Food choices if you have a room are worse than ever. No more real plates or flatware.. cheap plastic only. Snack bar is a joke. They announce they're open and you walk all the way there only to find their credit card machine isn't working.. and they don't take cash (so why did you even bother to announce the snack bar is open?) All the cars are old and ratty. A lot of the employees are very nice (but also too many with an attitude). But even if all the employees were amazing, it wouldn't make up for all the bad stuff. The old ratty cars don't bother me, nor the occasional surly employee or the lousy food and poor food selection, if only they could be remotely on time. Or barring that, TELL US WTH IS GOING ON so we could plan!  I could go on but you get the picture."
734,trustpilot.com,"As a novice train customer, it would be great to know up front and in no uncertain terms online that some tickets are basically Greyhound tickets. If I had wanted to ride a Greyhound bus, I'd have purchased a ticket through that particular business. Or I'd have taken a community transit bus for 1/4 of the cost and had much more room. My 9 year old is pretty disappointed."
735,trustpilot.com,"I sit in an old cabin interior that creaks with age as it slowly moves over an aging, bumpy, poorly mantained track. I listen to garbled words over an intercom that buzzes and sometimes squeeks, enduring multiple unscheduled stops to arrive at my station an hour and a half late. This was my experience. The entire executive team at Amtrak needs to be replaced with real leaders from Europe and Asia who know what they're doing. Amtrak is a national disgrace."
736,trustpilot.com,"I tried several times to purchase tickets today on line and each time the Amtrak on-line portal ""froze up"".  I tried calling customer service and the automated reply service said the wait time for an Amtrak customer representative was over 1 hour.   I am not going to bother with trying to make any further reservations with Amtrak"
737,trustpilot.com,"They sent me an email offering an business class upgrade lottery. My offer was accepted. My seat was one of the only two seats facing the rear of the train, with a customer sitting in front of me (facing me), with no reclining feature as the seat is flush up against the bathroom wall. Thanks a lot Amtrak! Never again!"
738,trustpilot.com,If I could give an -0I would very inconsiderate of customers money they have spent and travel time’s.There has been a number of extreme excuses made about Covid rulers and regulations.Amtrak has “So very Rude Employees”.Especially the ones walking up and down the aisle.We pay a lot of money have to follow a lot of rules.”What about Customer Service and Care”????Rules should have to apply to Amtrak Employees as well.Lower your Rates if your not going to Service Customers politely and Be more Cautious and respectful of the Schedule Times and Arrivals.
739,trustpilot.com,"Took the train to Portland Oregon and it went fine on the way there. On the way back, we had gotten a 4pm train, it got cancelled and there was no notification of the cancellation. Arrived at the station and that’s when we found out there was no train coming. Luckily there was another train at 7:30pm but even that train showed up an hour late with no updates on its whereabouts. Not sure if this is a Portland thing or a general Amtrak issue. Hopefully the former."
740,trustpilot.com,"I want to give NO stars! Amtrak is one of the MOST unsafe mode of transportation I have ever been on.  There was a fire on our train.  The fire extinguisher is OUTSIDE the train car, so we had to PRY open the door to get to the extinguisher.  The employees on our train did not know what to do or how to react in an emergency situation.  The train car filled with smoke 2 times and the employees did NOTHING but tell us to stay seated.  We were not allowed to get out of the train car. Unbelievable!  The fire was near a high voltage box, but no one seemed to care.  As a rider, I had to put out the fire myself.  The emergency might be considered an ""act of God"", but the response from Amtrak is deplorable.  Safety is NOT Amtrak's priority.  I put in a claim for Amtrak to pay my medical bills since I was injured, but they took an entire year and a half to FINALLY call me to say they were covering NOTHING.  Amtrak can sure give someone the ""run around""....that they are good at. BTW....we never got where we were going and did not get any help to get a new ticket or a refund.  Consideration for their passengers is at an all time LOW!  I did not hire a lawyer because I am naive and believe in doing what is right and believed Amtrak would do the same....my mistake."
741,trustpilot.com,"I called Amtrak and was told there would be a 3 hour wait time and I could get a call back . I got call back at 12:05 am. I was put on hold for another 42 minutes with no connection. I finally hung up. The next day I called again and left another call back number. I received call 1 hour later and waited another 6 minutes. Andre the customer service rep-with an accent mark over the e as he made sure he told me ,misunderstood me when I said I received an e ticket he sent. He believed I said I didn’t get it. He proceeded to put me in my place telling me I had to wait and I had no business telling him I didn’t get it so quickly.I said I didn’t say that and he proceeded to tell me he heard  it with his own ears. Amtrak supervisors please review the tape. Sunday 8/1 at approximately 12:15 pm"

743,trustpilot.com,"No customer service on phone, at station, or on train. Sent my disabled sister from Flagstaff to Santa Fe... Never again. Confusing information at both ends that conflicted with what was on our printed ticket. Employees just shrug their shoulders and claim they don't know anything about checking your luggage for you, even though our ticket said to show up 45 minutes early to check luggage. No ramp provided for handicapped travelers. My sister said she would rather take a bus next time.  Amtrak ignored ADA rules. Don't get taken in by their photos showing nice seating, service, etc. It isn't accurate. I called to complain... Still waiting for a call back."

745,trustpilot.com,"If there was a way to give no stars I would. The train is always delayed. Bought tickets for my friend on the southwest chief to NM and they were on time. At the union station in Ca she was told that she had to empty some of her stuff because her suitcase was to heavy. My friend then proceeded to throw away some of books that she was bringing with her into a locked trash can. After she did this, the lady at the counter said oh you can buy a box for $5.00 that you can put your stuff in. Then you can bring it on the train. My poor friend was in tears as these books were precious to her and now there gone forever. Then the train was over 2 hours late. To top it all off, the crew was rude. I’m so done!"
746,trustpilot.com,"Trip from Ann Arbor, MI to Chicago. Train was 25 minutes late to arrive. As I type this, we're stopped on the tracks because of some construction that is apparently happening that is preventing us from passing through. They cannot tell us when we'll be able to start moving again. It's already been about 30 minutes. Umm....this is a scheduled train. Why is this happening? Shouldn't construction times be coordinated with the train schedule??  Ridiculous! We were already running like an hour behind schedule. Now it's going to be more like 2 hours!!!  Awful! I'm wasting my vacation time sitting on a stationary train in the middle of nowhere. Thanks, Amtrak!"

Did the bid up option and never got an email either way, it’s specifically states that you get an email if it’s accepted or not accepted, got to the train station 30 minutes in advance and the rude guy working said he didn’t know. I said the email stated I would get an email either way and he said well apparently you didn’t get it. And wouldn’t help me upgrade at the station."

751,trustpilot.com,"After over 20 years where I’ve always taken Amtrak both single day and multiple day travel and enjoyed it, I see it coming to and end. I understand with Covid now things have to be redone or revised or restructured for safety. However to be on a train that is solely only feeding people in the dining car that are in the sleeping car seems very unbalanced to me, and the people who are in coach the only way we can eat is if we go to the snack car. I purchased my tickets online so for the second time this week I had contacted Amtrak asking  some questions and for the 2nd time I got a very rude customer representatives.  But at this point once I get done with this next trip that I have I will not take another train ride. And that saddens me because it’s my preferred way to travel!  Nothing not even COVID should make it ok to treat customers like that.  The fact that I can’t eat in the dining car unless I’ve paid an Exorbitant amount of money is ridiculous!  So thank you Amtrak for making me feel like I’m feeling now!  If you are opening up the train where anyone and everyone can sit on the train with anyone even if you don’t know them what’s the reason for Segregating people in coach to not be able to eat in the dining car?  Well my money will be getting after this trip that’s too bad so very disappointing."

756,trustpilot.com,"We decided to splurge for a sleeper car from Portland to Seattle and after a 2.5 hour delay, we finally boarded.  Thirty min into the trip we wanted a drink and went to the lounge to find a sign stating it was closed for an hour bc the attendant was on dinner break.  We then went to the dining car and were met with a real attitude of a waiter.  The waiter said the train had no refrigeration so no cold beer or wine.  The service was horrible - these employees do not like customers!  I asked if they could chill some wine and of course they could not.  We went back to the lounge car when it re-opened and we’re told they only had water.  No apologies.  I’ve never seen anything like this and obviously will not be taking another Amtrak train!"
757,trustpilot.com,"Our trip to New York on 6/18/21 from Denver was delayed 5 hours. When we boarded, we were told to sit anywhere so we sat downstairs by the bathrooms which was great for us, but we were hustled upstairs by a porter that was rude. The stairs are not friendly to older people and that staircase is not a good idea as only one person fits at a time.  The bathrooms were so filthy that wipes were useless and you either stepped through pee, or stuck to the floor! Wasing your hands (laugh) the sink was a toilet bowl.  We were in coach, yes and treated like scum on your shoe.  I was expecting to at least sit in the dining room, NO, you are not one of our sleeper passengers! We had an overcooked hot dog,a hamburger,two bags of lunch box chips and two cokes, price 22.00! Half the hot dog was overcooked.  The observation car was like a sauna so could not stay in there.  We changed trains in Chicago to the Lakeshore. The workers were so helpfull. The train was all on one level and we had more legroom.  It was easier to move about but again the bathrooms were so filthy even though they were bigger.  We learn sometimes the hard way and we learned never take the train!!"
758,trustpilot.com,"Overall our experience was ok, and considering the affordability, it was more than ok.  Our first train from OMA to CHI was two hours late.  Also, considering how long some people are on the trains, I DEFINITELY  think a vegetable and a fruit option need to be added to the dining cart.  There was not a single vegi or fruit to purchase, and a banana or apple of carrot sticks could be added for very low cost/waste! What I did enjoy was the friendly staff and very comfy coach seats.  I would definitely travel this way again."
759,trustpilot.com,"Where to start. We heard every excuse in the book for delays- switching issues, lightning striking signals, traffic, etc. etc. These are all things you should be able to account for when you run the same route every day. Their process for seating folks is archaic and chaotic- you get a different set of directions from every porter. No assigned seats in coach. Some folks that got on later had no place to sit.  The system is so inefficient and needs to be totally revamped. We really need an effective alternative to driving and flying but this is not it.  Before we give more funding to Amtrak to expand, they really need to lmprove what they are already doing."
760,trustpilot.com,"Took teenaged grandsons on trip from Atlanta to NYC. Going, the trip was good, DeWayne, our attendant, provided excellent service. Being a foodie, both meals were not tasty. The Holiday Inn was acceptable and the mobile police unit in front made for feelings of safety. Breakfast was not provided although it was supposed to be included. Hotel had no dining facility. Staff was very attentive and courteous. The place to redeem Big Bus voucher was no longer at Madam T so had to search and finally found it outside the M&M store. I recommend changing bus services to Top View because our tour was very disappointing, staff very rude when asked simple questions. Missed out on using any of the attractions on City Pass which were included. All attractions closed by 6:pm and would have had to go by taxi, Uber, or Subway to visit them. Overall, pretty disappointed with the included items. I don’t feel I got what I paid for."
761,trustpilot.com,"Rude, rude and rude staff. Don't do this, get out of there. No wifi, filthy bathrooms, 4 hours late, not a pleasant experience as their marketing suggests. The views? None...as most of the trip is traveling through overgrown brush on both sides of the track. What you do see are the poorest, most run down sections of the major cities the train passes through. Horrible experience."
762,trustpilot.com,"SO uncomfortable! My elderly mother and I paid a small fortune to travel from Boston to Denver. The roomette was TINY, the seats were hard as bricks, and the upper bunk had a foot and a half clearance. I had to move around like Gollum. Announcements are supposed to stop at 10 pm, but they continued to blare over the loudspeaker in my ear until 11:30 pm. Needless to say, we do NOT want to make the 3 day return trip. I contacted an agent and explained that the trip caused ACTUAL, PHYSICAL pain, and that we wanted to cancel the return trip. I was told that not only would they not refund the money, we would only receive a credit that would need to be used within a year. By US. We are the only ones who can use the credit.  WHY WOULD WE EVER WANT TO RIDE THE TRAIN AGAIN IF WE HATED IT SO MUCH IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE WANTED TO CANCEL IT???I'm sure my adult children could find some use for this credit if I were able to transfer it to them. I don't know why the company cares who uses the tickets, as long as they're getting their money. So we're stuck with 2 choices.Cancel the return trip and eat the $1400 we spent, or suck it up and go through 3 more days of hell to get home. Not cool, Amtrak.Not cool. (Oh and I almost forgot, the agent with whom I spoke was SO. RUDE. Not even the obligatory insincere apology was offered.)"
763,trustpilot.com,We were surprised by the shabby condition of the bedroom in the decades old sleeper car. The staff was arrogant and impatient with us except for one dumpy dressed lady in the cafe car and one very nice male attendant both of whom made that leg of our trip almost bearable. My wife got bitten twice by what I believe to be bed bugs. I personally felt something crawling on me but wasn't bitten. May be my last Amtrak roundup.
764,trustpilot.com,"Right now I am grateful Amtrak put me in a nice hotel. Very nice.  But it hardly makes up for what my husband , daughter and I put up with today.  Our train was delayed 6 hours so instead of leaving at 7 PM we left at 1 AM. But I can understand that things happen but what was a million times worse was the way we were treated by staff.  Not all but most of the staff deserves to be fired !!! Very rude and condescending. No clear communication.  Is it because it is government run ?  We have a business of our own and if I would treat my clients and customers the way we were treated today I would lose my business.  If you respond to this and let me know action was taken and staff was made aware of their inappropriate actions I may change my mind but I may never ride Amtrak again and I will make sure my friends and family don’t either. When getting off the train a couple was in front of us and the man was in a wheelchair. Instead of taking the time to set up a ramp the staff just bumped him off the train.  Rude and insensitive!!! We traveled from Denver to Chicago on July 4th .  The staff at the Chicago station were great.  I’m not normally a negative or complaining person but I had enough today. And you should take note because according to your reviews I’m not the only one."
765,trustpilot.com,We took the train round trip from Denver to Hlenwood Springs for a weekend visit. We were so disappointed.  Train 2 hours late leaving  of Denver and over three hours late leaving Glenwood Springs returning to Denver. Train was dirty the vents above the seats were plugged with dust and dirt. We just had coach seats as it is only a 5 hour ride....when we were on the train we learned coach passengers were not eligible to dine in the dining car..what? Why were we not toldthis when we booked? Glenwood springs Station has hardly any benches outside. Really a pretty awful experience.  Shame on you Amtrak...we do not get vacation time to often...this was a huge disappointment. I would recommend making other plans.
766,trustpilot.com,"Made multiple calls, texts, chats  to Amtrak regarding my vehicle’s ability to fit on the auto train. I was assured it would fit. When I got specific requesting to speak to a vehicle specialist One agent hung up on me others told me their are no specialists.  When arrived at Lortan VA the guy measured my vehicle and it was too large for the auto train"
767,trustpilot.com,"We just returned from a trip on the Empire Builder between St. Paul and Chicago. We were two hours late arriving in St. Paul and two-and-a-half hours late coming home. We had only our lunch and no dinner; food service is very poor quality and insanely expensive ($17 for 2 drinks and a snack sized popcorn.)We were so late returning to Chicago that it was another two hours until the next commuter train to our town and so our ride from the commuter station to our house was canceled. We had to scramble to arrange for another ride and instead of arriving home around 5, we got there at about 11 p.m.  There's no WiFi on the train and the electrical outlets did not work so I had to go to another car to charge my phone.Masking was enforced haphazardly. I had mine, but when I pulled it down for awhile I was admonished while others in the car, who hadn't any mask in their possession, were ignored. The long trip home was exhausting. We could have driven It in 6 hours but taking Amtrak made it about 15."
768,trustpilot.com,I too took the Texas Eagle.  The crew was rude and abusive.  I seen one who repeatedly threatened to throw people off of the train.  I'm finished with train travel.
769,trustpilot.com,"I paid $66  for a two hour ride from Hudson to NYC, which is way more expensive  than Metronorth. The train arrived more than half an hour late and continued  to lose time because  they are too cheap to spend the money to negotiate  a decent passage on the tracks and we followed a local train down the tracks being held on the tracks frequently, finally arriving in NYC after close to four hours. Faster to walk!!!!"
770,trustpilot.com,"Vacation from hell!!! Worst business decisions and completely NOT customer oriented. They switched my reservation without my consent and couldn't use proper means of contacting me to tell me. 8 had booked my family room over 6 months in advance and my family got booted and some other family got our seats. Turned into over a 14 hour wait for the next flight, had to pay for an extra nights hotel stay, and an extra days car rental. Shameful!!! Most worthless company ever!! Even Trump's Taj Mahal casino is a better company than garbage Amtrak. Amtrak = Sweaty Asscrak!"
771,trustpilot.com,"Paid for a round trip ticket and just wanted to modify the time, but they said the ticket going back was on hold because the payment went through but you pay a round trip ticket once and I had charges. They tried to charge me again to get a new ticket and wouldn't even give us any discount or an apology. Never using Amtrak again we spent all day using customer service and they are useless."

773,trustpilot.com,"My journey with Amtrak was bittersweet. I am a senior with disability who traveled in a sleeper room from Newark Penn to LA & back. Going to LA with Cardinal & Southwest Chief was smooth sailing,,,.took me three days only as per schedule....good service and assistance from the room attendants with special mention to Doris.She was a sweetheart!Coming back, I took the Texas Eagle from LA to Chicago. I was so disappointed with food service & assistance. I spent three nights in a sleeper room without knowing who the room assistant is. Different people came knocking my door getting my lunch orders. A lady took my order for a cup of tea....didn't get it. The following day, I didn't order breakfast, just a cup of tea. Announced breakfast is closed, never get my tea again. Pressed the attendant button, nobody came. Is that good service? Arrival in Chicago was supposed to be at 1:52 p.m....arrived past 7pm.,,,missed my train! Thanks for the complimentary hotel I had a restful night. From Chicago back to Newark Penn was ok ...got the service i expected. My thanks to Ameerah at Pittsburgh Station, Ferry of Capitol Limited, Richard of Pennsylvanian, & Tranhardner, the Red Cap Attendant at Newark Penn. They made sure i get the assistance I needed."
774,trustpilot.com,Riding Amtrak from Charlotte to Baltimore was one of the worst travel experiences I have yet to encountered. The ride itself was ok but the staff not so much.. My family of 5 including my Grandmother and Aunt who are 69 and 80  were also treated very poorly by Amtrak staff. This started from the moment we walked into the train station until we arrived in Baltimore. The ride back home was nothing like the ride there... The attendants seemed to make it their business to have nasty attitudes. Our family was grieving during this time and headed to home going services for a family member so the added stress from the staff made our unexpected trip 10 times worst.
775,trustpilot.com,"Unfortunately after not having  taken the train in a few years , I can say it hasn’t improved!The stations are usually ok  but the Bathrooms are not attended to.  Recently my trip was a combination of delays, poor internet  and listening to an extremely loud foul mouthed woman .  Here disgusting , offensive mouth was heard by many nearby for the entire trip.  Call after call (to everyone she knew) she reiterated her story about  being robbed( not so eloquently stated)  at the Utica station in upstate NY.   No one walks/monitors   the train cars so you can’t even request assistance/complain. Changing seats wouldn’t help that’s how loud she was. 4 hours turned  into a 6 hour nightmare. I’ll stick to driving , gas would have been less even at $3/gallon, drive time 4 hrs.  The peace and quiet of the car is worth the effort I’d like a refund!"
776,trustpilot.com,"You will not get assistance from their phony calling almost none customer services as well as some live both locations. Very un realistic none listening confusing you, un able to performed their task if any? A lived both ticketing said to me very rudely, i am busy now with a customer (typing or looking on computer screen) i can not help you! Ahhh, American only can do one thing at a time? Ahh if i where senior or disable? I will had missed the train...! Only needed to asked a question! But this female braided balloon was insanely mean and like Americans said racist!! The phony female was so confused herself none patiences asking same questions many times and said to me, do not understand her many many times white t... like Americans said, thinking she must be sleeping! Many of those worker?? Are so used to their positions for ever that they only going there to gobblers stuffed themself foods complaining gossiping and watching the clock to chocked out..!!!!!!!! Seeing many times, just like usps live clerks!..!! Very expensive rides, rudest/no services, smells strong fragrances few/more than few conductors! A lot of junk Asstrak... Nastiest..!!!"
777,trustpilot.com,"Right now I’m a little upset. I have never been on an Amtrak train that doesn’t EVER ...no, not once given us a location of where we are. Or...doesn’t bother telling people going into a town that they are running 30 minutes behind schedule! They have NEVER said anything. I just finally asked, because it was getting close to our arrival. We have people waiting for us that had to have another car come along to hold us all. So ridiculous to not have gotten any notice. This is the Coast Starlight train."
778,trustpilot.com,Took the train because me and my partner thought it would be easier on the baby and it was. Had a good experience all up until on the return journey I  got triggered by one of the employees telling me if my child makes noise I'll have to relocate. First off the baby was eating a bottle and very tired. About to sleep and some self important fat man wants to flex imaginary authority over a child whimpering for a brief moment while he lost grip on the bottle. Glad that the train is so family friendly. If you don't want children in the quiet cars which is no different at all from the regular coach you should make that clear instead of passive aggressive comments that make your customers angry and uncomfortable. Train 170 from NYC to Boston South station. June 7
779,trustpilot.com,"Disgusting, bathrooms like portopotty are never cleaned.alcohol is sold so drunk men urinate on everything..NOT FOR TRAVELING WITH CHILDREN. Changing table folds down OVER the toilet seat. There is no bathroom big enough to accommodate a child and parent. Cafe car is very far and downstairs as well as bathrooms. My ticket said downstairs but were no downstairs seating. HORRIBLE. NOT ACCOMMODATING FOR MINORS."
780,trustpilot.com,"The horrible lack of communication through Amtrak Vacations is our biggest complaint. April 2021 we arrived at the Maricopa AZ station at 5am to head to New Orleans only to learn the train would be SIX HOURS LATE! No notification by text or email! We didn’t get to our hotel until 4am only to rise at 7:30am for a city bus tour. Then later that day we arrived at 6pm for our scheduled steamboat cruise with jazz and dinner only to learn it was canceled several days prior due to mechanical issues. Again NO communication. I wrote Amtrak on 4/30 for a refund and today is 5/25 and no response to our letter. I just now spoke to Amtrak guest relations (on hold 40 min) and there was no awareness of our canceled cruise. Fortunately she believed me and will refund the $216 on our credit card. Additionally, if you are on a schedule, Amtrak is not a good choice. Even on our return trip we never arrived at any stop on time. We will not use Amtrak again."
781,trustpilot.com,Took the big chief from river side CA. To Albuquerque new mexico in 2019. When I boarded the train their was a white albino male sitting on the chair next to my ticket location. When I proceed to sit down he made a comment about my presence next to him. When the ticket master came threw I brought the situation to his attention. He told me to shut up and sit down. I refused to sit next to this racist bigot. The worst thing about this situation is I had to ride your train standing up from River side CA. To Albuquerque NM. At one point a group of people came up to me looked up and down and left. This experiance is the last time I will ever ride this toilet dirty so called fun experience. Anthony e sanchez
782,trustpilot.com,"My husband and I rode on the Texas eagle on 5/7/2021 to Dallas Tx. 1).  Staff not disinfecting the seat or restrooms on a daily due to Cov19. Restrooms very nasty. Chances of catching cov19 on these trains are high. A fight broke out on train due to a man excessively cough and he was not thrown off train because he was sick. Amtrak don’t inspect their customers for temperatures checks or wellness check up. Poor selection of food and high prices. My seating section was so dirty, I asked for a vacuum or broom so I can clean my area. The man with the white shirt told me they don’t have cleaning items on the train. On the way back 5/10, train 421. A Spanish man calling people N word loud on the train . I am person of color so I was so upset. I didn’t say anything because I wanted to get home. Amtrak trains are nasty. Not safe to ride because of Cov19. Worker don’t clean trains or disinfect seat after each customers ride. Never again!!!!"
783,trustpilot.com,"By far my worst experience ever especially being it my first time riding with Amtrak. I found myself kind of being stuck in Reston, VA as I was seeking last minute flights back to Florida. Tix were so expensive ($200-$300) for a one way, so I was trying different alternatives for finding a way back home. I discovered that Amtrak station was not far from where I was currently staying with a friend. I booked the tix at $155 one-way to Ftl thinking I could relax, read, and finish up with work. Boy was I in for a rude awakening! Everything was smooth until the train took off. I had my own mask and was minding my own business until a staff collecting tix stopped in my area. He asked me where I was headed and told him Fort Lauderdale. He then asked me to adjust my mask so that it covered my nose, in which I did. Assumed he did not like my mask, he pulled out an extra one and told me to put that mask on in which I did. 30 mins later same dude walks by and ask me to pull up my mask. I looked at him and said, ""Sir my mask is on, what more do you want?"" He claimed it wasn't over my nose enough. In my head, I'm thinking ""Is this dude serious??!!"" In any case, I pulled my mask up and continued doing what I was doing (reading and listening to music). Then like 40-45 mins later same dude comes BACK around (mind you its like 10/11pm) and stops in my area. He asked again for me to adjust my mask. I had to stop and think for a moment and really ask myself, ""Is this dude just going to harass me the whole time about how to ""properly"" where this damn mask? Keep in mind barely no one was on the train. I clearly was abiding by the six feet social distancing rule and my mask was on. So I said to him, ""Sir, not sure exactly how you want me to wear this mask you gave me because I believe I am wearing it properly but if you would like me to wear tape to properly hold up my mask over my whole nose you can definitely bring some so I can gladly adjust to your liking"". He must've got pissed because he comes back with his supervisor. His supervisor now asks me what the issue is in which I let her know I didn't think there was one. She mentioned its Amtrak policy to cover all of nose and mouth with mask. I tell her that is what I am doing, but keep in mind people do have to eat and drink and when this happens the mask cannot be on my face. I also asked her to bring me tape and if this would satisfy her staff from harassing me especially that I am a paying customer. She returns with the police, Wow!!! I was asleep as it was past midnight and I wake up to lights being shined in my face. I get escorted off the train in a town I never heard of before and when I get inside the station they tell me the next train isn't until the next day at night and I would have to buy another ticket. Are you f#$%^ kidding me???!!! I call customer service and they refused to issue a refund. What an experience!!!! Not sure if I should blame China covid or Amtrak because as a first time passenger on this train, they definitely treated me and a few others as if we were not paying customers and disregarded us off their train in the middle of nowhere as if we hopped on for free. Even the cops who escorted myself & others off the train was in shock when he found out that we got kicked off over a mask!!!! Though this event just happened, I most certainly will be fighting Amtrak and disputing w/my credit card on this $155 transaction. Not only is Amtrak refusing to even give me partial refund, they threw numerous ppl off in the middle of the early morning in the middle of only god knows where.I am not familiar with Rocky Moutains, NC at all! Leaving us with no stay or alternative transportation. One of the people who also got kicked off was a parent with a small child. They were not open nor willing to work out something with us on perhaps catching another train or even helping to accommodate us on stay. As a result of this matter, I would never again get on an Amtrak train and I will see to it that I post this review on as many sites and social media platforms so that people can see how unethical Amtrak is to their customers. I am still awaiting for corporate to get back to me on this matter. Reserve#24DCFC Case#5730234"
784,trustpilot.com,I really am questioning my decision on traveling by train to NJ from NC. The customer service is horrible. They charged my card three times for tickets and when i tried to upgrade they wanted to charge me double the price for their system errors. I am hoping i don't catch co-vid because i seems they are overpacking trains.
785,trustpilot.com,Worst ever I'll never do it again . First of all went to Snacks to purchase they said cash only so about half the people on train had nothing and some going alot further than I was . The staff wasn't all that professional and rude to say the last they were running behind an hr not to mention we were also told to keep mask on and if we were eating we were to pull mask off take a bite of our food then put mask on and repeat until food finished HELLO THEIR IS A VIRUS GOING AROUND SO TO ASK US TO REPEADALY TO TOUCH OUR MASK AFTER EACH BITE OF OUR FOOD TO THEN TOUCH IT AGAIN TO PULL IT UP THE WHOLE TIME WERE EATING IS DISGUSTING AND AGAINST THE LAW NOT TO MENTION IF WE DIDNT ABIDE WE WOULD BE KICKED OFF . MY WHOLE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE WAS HORRIBLE NOT TO MENTON I COULDN'T PAY WITH CASH BUT STAFF WAS ABLE TO TAKE CASH FOR TIPS LOL HORRIBLE. I DO PLAN TO GO FURTHER ABOUT THIS
786,trustpilot.com,"My review has a lot to do with safety precautions.  Honestly if you are not fully vaccinated and a little nervous I am not sure you would feel safe.  I cannot get over how many passengers were not wearing masks and the crew not only did nothing about it but a few did not have their masks on.  The people at the Albany train station did not ask people to put on their masks and sat by and literally did nothing when someone asked a person to wear a mask and this person became very angry. They literally just watched and never called security.  Staff all seemed tired, grumpy and impatient with customers.  I have ridden the train many times and on a positive note the bathrooms were cleaner than in the past. But if people wearing masks are important to you this is not the time to take the train."
787,trustpilot.com,The Amtrak Travel insurance with the 3rd party company Allianz is a joke! Go ahead and cancel and they will put you thru hell to get a refund. So much paperwork and a note from a Dr if you are not felling well. Skip the insurance
788,trustpilot.com,Let me say first this review is about the train service and the worthless customer service Amtrak provides or should I say fails to provide. The stewards on the train both ways were excellent. We took the Amtrak autotrain in November 2020. I called and changed my reservation to come back home a day earlier due to a family emergency. Three hours into the trip the train broke down. They gave us no information on the train as to why we were stopped or how long it will take. We should of arrived in Virginia at 8:30 am but instead arrived at 5:00 pm. 8 1/2 hours later and right into the heart of rush hour traffic getting home. My 4 hour drive turned into a 6 hour drive. I contacted Amtrak the next day because I definitely feel we should of gotten some form of compensation for the extra 10 hours of my life that I’ll never get back. They responded immediately with an email saying they would look into it and get back to me within 30-60 days. In is now over 5 months and the absolutely worthless customer service has never gotten back to me and have also not answered two more emails I have sent. I will never use Amtrak again and I have told everyone I know who was considering it not to use them either. Amtrak customer service sucks
789,trustpilot.com,Recently made a Car Train reservation for an Amtrak special ticket price.  Price was advertised with no change fees.  Had to change the reservation date and was still charged an additional $335 fee (back up to the regular ticket price) to make the change.  That or cancellation fee to drop the reservation.  Caught between a rock and a hard place!  WE WILL NEVER USE Amtrak Again!

793,trustpilot.com,Absolutely senseless! They require a mask.
794,trustpilot.com,Train 449 from Pittsfield MA to Boston MA during Covid. We had a roomette to be by ourselves. Instead of stopping the train so that roomette and bedroom people could get on we had to go through two cars to get to our roomette car. We opted for this car and paid more so that we would not have any contact with other passengers. This needs to be fixed please. The ride was wonderful as I have taken it a LOT of times. This was my husbands first time and he loved it. The wifi worked great and we were able to connect both our computers and our phone to play music. The train conductor for our car was not present except for when we got on and when we got off. How I sadly miss Curtis that was always on this line He passed away just two weeks after his retirement.
795,trustpilot.com,So I’m heading back to DC from Penn Station @Amtrak Acela 2253While most of the train is empty I’m seated in the back of a man who keeps coughing NON STOP. I asked the conductor what can we do and in return he caught a huge attitude and said “you’ll  be “ok”  because the back of the seat is enough and walked off... why be so rude!? We are in a middle of a pandemic 😷 yet his response is basically to “fffkk  off ” is how i took it. I refuse to believe some people are this way and are employed with a company like @Amtrak 😡
796,trustpilot.com,"For me Amtrak is a nice way to travel and see parts of the county that you cannot see from a plane, car, bus or bike. Many place to explore. Big towns, small towns and those towns in between. Ride the train and ride the nostalgia!"

798,trustpilot.com,"We travelled in train # 6 from Nebraska to Illinois. The train was 1 hour late, so it went faster tokeep on schedule. I did not enjoy it. Previously, train had gone smoothly. Another was that there were more passangers and I thought that they would put seats farther apart due to COVID 19. In fact, there were far more passangers in this trip than other we took last year. This is probably die to the fact that trains do not run every day, but 3 times a week only.  Another thing was that the passanger next to our seats was without shoes and he would lay with his feet out and it was very uncomfortable for us.  Finally, bathrooms were dirty. I did not feel comfortable. So I would like Amtrak to not just say it, but do something about these issues. I think that costumers deserve a better service."
799,trustpilot.com,The experience was ok for a first timer but the food expensive and the some of the workers are rude n not good and as for a diabetic who didn’t know much and didn’t have my card or cash sucked bc I had slick remarks towards me and this was amtrack empire building train
800,trustpilot.com,"I am currently riding Amtrak train from LA to Portland. 1st of all there is absolutely no social distancing going on in here as every seat is filled up on this one car (#13)...Seems like the conductor's placed everyone on this one damn car to make their job easier! Since the trains are only leaving 3 days a week and riding at 50% compacity there is no way none of this should be going on!! Passengers are coughing, not wearing their mask and to top it off theirs a crazy lady sitting across from me filming people and cussing people out! Several passengers have went to the conductor's about her crazy behavior but not one has come to address it!! She nearly got assaulted by another passenger for using hate speech toward them. This is completely unacceptable & insane! it is 2:30 am and while the conductor's are off sleeping somewhere we can't get any! Bunch of lazy workers and the ridership sucks. Would have been better off walking!! Screw Amtrak and it's dirty filthy trains!!!!!"
801,trustpilot.com,"I am currently on this train; Texas Eagle. They want me to wear a mask 24/7, but they don't do temp checks or ask boarding passengers any questions. They don't search bags. I understand wearing a mask for when you are up and about, but when we are sitting in one spot for 24+ hours, we should be able to take them off. They don't clean the trains; found trash and old orange rinds in the cup holder. My advice....plane tickets are as cheap if not cheaper....fly to and from...so you only have to wear the mask for a few hours."
802,trustpilot.com,"I’ve been using Amtrak for the past 3 years to go to Orlando Florida from New York City and back. Before I would rate it alright because most of time it will get delayed along the way to the destination, but won’t get there too late or even on time sometimes. However one year there was a huge delay that we stayed in a station in Georgia for 2 hours and just at a stand still on the tracks for 3 hours and got 4 hours late to our destination. But this year, will be my last and final year traveling this way. My item was literally stolen when I got out of my seat to the cafe car for less than 5 minutes. They can at least add cameras somewhere. Before I used to leave items out all the time, but this time I guess someone lost their dignity and decided to steal a charger."
803,trustpilot.com,"Overall, Amtrak offers mid-range accommodations for a basic train ticket. Mask coverings aren’t even worn by half of the passengers if they just “don’t feel like it”. One of my major complaints is timing. There are certain trains that have no other running times and those times are in the middle of the night. Mind you, when I say middle of the night, you’re looking at 12:00 am to 1:00 am. Sometimes you can get a decent time, but only in bigger cities. I think this entire concept is ridiculous as it makes all passengers who need to get to certain places, have to travel at horrendous times. What is worse is that when you schedule these, they make sure you can’t refund them for money to buy bus tickets or anything far more convenient. I think service is okay, but scheduling needs to be massively adjusted. If it is a COVID issue, you should have planned for this 6 months ago when this all first started. Think about your customers and their needs before you put your trains first."
804,trustpilot.com,My sister and I took Amtrak round trip from Syracuse NY to Niagara Falls NY.It was a very nice experience.We never took amtrak before.I was very impressed.The people were very nice and the train was very comfortable.I cant wait to go again!
805,trustpilot.com,"Simple trips never work out with these guys.I take the train from Boston to Maine quite frequently, the last 6 times I've used the train it has been upwards of an hour+ late due to outdated technology and ""signal errors"". It almost seems like they should have been using the quarantine time to renovate their systems and technology, instead of making a 3 hour train ride into a 4-5 hour trip. They don't respect your time, so don't show them the business until they get their act together."
806,trustpilot.com,"I purchased a trip from LA to the Grand Canyon for myself, a Senior, and a young granddaughter. The trip involved 2 stages by Amtrak and 2 by bus. Found out the week before that 1 of the buses was no longer running and that I'd need to get myself from the Amtrak depot in Flagstaff into the Park. Had I not found out on my own, I'd have been left stranded at 4am. They offered me NO refund, but did offer the name of a taxi company (and I'd already paid for the bus leg). I phoned, emailed, phoned, emailed and finally turned it over to my C/c company who refunded all of my money. I frequently travel with Amtrak, and will continue to do so, but will NEVER book another trip with their package tour partner, Yankee Leisure."
807,trustpilot.com,"I am currently going through an absolute nightmare with Amtrak.My Wife and I had planned a cross-country trip for our 25th Anniversary. Purchase in March for September 2020. I put the deposit down with our debit card, then immediately removed/changed to our CC to add additional trip protection etc. as well as purchasing their own travel protection plan.By June we realized it would be in our best interest to cancel this trip until things may or might settle down with Covid-19. I called and canceled and figured that was that.Yesterday afternoon they wiped out our checking account and over drafted us by thousands of dollars.They are now actually fighting us on this, saying they have no record of the cancellation. I said fine then cancel us now. They stated that we are not entitled to a refund. That we are only eligible for future travel vouchers. This is despite all of their advertising, emails and website stating that there will be ""No Hassles Refunds with no fees"" for all trips booked before April 20th due to Covi-19.  I have spoken with several agents who are telling me that they never give money back, only travel vouchers. We currently filing a dispute with our credit union as we have run out of options. We currently can not pay our bills, and we have been robbed of any alternative vacation plans as we have absolutely no intention of traveling with Amtrak ever! Theives and Liars!"
808,trustpilot.com,I booked my auto train trip from Sanford FL to Lorton VA and back for our annual family vacation. This was the first and last trip I will ever take. I had a roomete and my son went with me. I could not sleep because of the shaking and the constant train horn. We where delayed at first because of a software glitch. The trip had many offensive smells. The urine smell of the bedding was totally avoidable if they had proper cleaning services. There was a pass by a landfill that took a while and a paper manufacturing plant. I was initially told I could cancel my trip anytime and when I tried to cancel the return they wouldn't.  I have a complaint filed with my bank against them. No matter what happens I am not getting on that train and will happily drive home. To top it all off they removed a Covid positive employee at the Lorton station.

Never take this companies trains, employees are good people but this company just doesn’t care.  Another passenger even joked and said they felt like they were in a mobile jail and they’re right, going 8 hour stretches without fresh air during a pandemic really shows you care Amtrak nice work.  All I know is thank goodness for cancel culture because Amtrak is long overdue"
810,trustpilot.com,First off when the city was closed from riots they could give me no information and told me it to try to go through the national guard to get to my train. after I've been on the phone with the police department saying if I came down to Cleveland I would be arrested so therefore I called back again they could not give me any information so I rescheduled my train for 10 days out because I didn't know what else to do and the lady on the other side of the phone for your company was no help at all and very rude. so finally my day comes up again and I make it to the train station and because I'm moving to Florida and have so much baggage they give me attitude right away is her freaking out. so I pack everything up a separate everything and the price for the shipping was way off from what the lady told me beforehand like a buy $100 o they do not take cash right now so there was no way for me to pay because all I had was Cash. A lady I did not know how do you use her credit card to pay for my luggage check and I gave her the money. Thank God a stranger was there to help me because your company was no help at all. Sono I am sitting in the streets of Cleveland with all my carry-on luggage because the Amtrak station closes it doesn't open till midnight so now I'm sitting in the middle of Cleveland where I know no one and have nowhere to go and I'm sitting on the streets after $800 Amtrak ticket. This is the absolute worst travel and experience I have had between uninformed mative information of the riots and how to deal with it to the nobody told me cash only or a credit cards only and leave me stuck here in the city where I know no one and have nowhere to go and I haven't even made it on the train yet I mean what is going to be my experience getting on the train because it has been horrible so far horrible all I want to do is go home and you're making it almost impossible and just keep taking my money. I couldn't even sit in the parking lot and wait for the train station the open they literally made me leave the ground with all of my carry-on luggage and go into the streets of Cleveland where I know no one and have nowhere to go. If this is how you treat your customers that pay well to travel well I hate to see how you treat your customers that buy the lower rate tickets it must be horrible because your policies almost make it impossible to travel and make it a very difficult experience. Which is not what you want after dropping so much money to move the Florida and using Amtrak cuz it was recommended because of the shipping fees were supposed to be lower and here I am having my stuff is with a stranger and I don't know I gave it away she's supposed to mail me a couple of boxes back I don't know if she will who knows she just made out if she didn't. And I'm stuck here all day until midnight when the train station opens again and the streets of Cleveland like a homeless person after paid $800 for all my check baggage . I am at a loss of words and your company is really needs to go over their policies because you made my travel and experience terrible I've cried several times this is a nightmare all I want to do is go home and here I am on the streets like a homeless person with all my carry-on luggage wondering how I'm going to make it back to the strain tasting at midnight because I've already paid $40 for a ride from Lodi to Cleveland to catch my train last nighr. this is how you treat your customers you throw them out of the streets like a homeless person while they're waiting on a train that you forced the person to miss because you would not take her cash. you really need to review your company policies and talk to your employees of how to handle them a little bit better when you're telling someone they have to give up more of what they own and they don't like you and they only take a credit card and they won't take your money and they have no other advice for you and they tell you nothing. Amtrak is horrible I will never travel aga
811,trustpilot.com,Terrible. Overpriced. There’s nothing else to it. It’s just bad. Just shy of a really bad score because the staff was friendly. 60 bucks per person from NYC to Poughkeepsie is ridiculous.
812,trustpilot.com,"Terrible customer service. I submitted a request for a refund on 4/1/20. The woman who took my call gathered all my information and didn't submit my refund request. I called again a couple of weeks later because I didn't get my refund and a woman with the same name, said that the first woman didn't submit my refund request. She gather again all my information and said for me to wait for two weeks to get my refund. I waited for three weeks, no refund. I called again and another woman tells me that a refund was issued on 5/20 and I should call again at the end of the week if I didn't get it. Well, I didn't get my refund. I called again and now another woman is telling me that my bank didn't say if it will accept the refund. That sounded very odd. I never heard of a Bank not accepting refunds into their clients' accounts.  She suggested for me to call my Bank. I did it. Sure enough, my bank said that they don't hold on refunds to be credited into their client's accounts. I called Amtrak again and told them what my bank said. The only thing that man that answered this time could say is that accounts payable is looking into it and I should call back on Wednesday. So, I don't have my refund as of today. It is clear that someone or some people drop the ball and they are not handling this well. The supervisor didn't even talk to me to let me know that she/he personally will take care of it. Perhaps s/he doesn't really care. All this is not even mentioning the long wait to get to talk to someone or while I was waiting for them to ""solve"" my problem. If anyone knows who should I talk to so I can actually be heard? I feel that that they are passing me around from one customer assistant to another hoping that I will get tired and not call back to get my refund."
813,trustpilot.com,Brilliant company! I live in UK and bought return tickets from NYC-BostonWhole trip cancelled due to Covid 19.Phoned them and they refunded straight away.
814,trustpilot.com,"No cancellation fees during COVID is a scam. They dont refund your money, only give you a voucher."
815,trustpilot.com,I tried to modify my reservation today on Amtrak. I was lead to believe I would be able to change my reservation without penalty thru May 31st. That was not the case. I have been an Amtrak rider for many years. Recently they offered a buy one ride and get a companion free. I booked my train for my grandsons birthday. Obviously we are not able to travel now. We were traveling to CT thru NY so !! This is a pandemic!! I was told they would not honor the offer and we would have to pay the difference in our fee. This is in my opinion poor business! Shame on you Amtrak !! Do the right thing !! Honor your offers to your customers.
816,trustpilot.com,"I'm sure Amtrak works fine when everything else is fine, but when there is an emergency they are unresponsive and not helpful. For international visitors it is pretty much impossible to get in contact with Amtrak. I wrote them about a month ago regarding the US border closing and the possibility of getting a refund for my ticket. I still haven't heard back from them.They did send a general notice saying that people were advised not to leave NY etc. which again should call for some kind of refund when you bought a ticket out of NY, but apparently not.I can understand that this is a difficult situation, but you still need to be there for your costumers.In the hopes that Amtrak will at least improve their means of communication in the future.--In the end going through social media helped. Help was quick here."
817,trustpilot.com,My son wanted to visit me so planned a trip not knowing that a deadly virus would be happening. He had to cancel and Still was out $200.00! That is horrible! He should have at least gotten a credit to use at a different time! Stay away from this horrible place!
818,trustpilot.com,"March 12, 2020Train 19Anniston, AL to Hattiesburg, MSI had never taken a passenger train before so I decided to do it for fun.  It's awful.  The train kept having issue after issue.   As of writing this, we are still traveling.  Currently three hours late on a six hour trip.............   I fully expect the amount of time we are behind schedule will only increase since it has constantly this whole trip. They make announcements sometimes but you cant hear them over everyone playing their phones loudly or just generally trying to over talk each other.  The only reason I was able to coordinate my time of arrival was their website.  Not the best website but their ""how late is your train"" part works depressingly well.I would not recommend.  There was nothing enjoyable about it.  It would have cost only slightly more to drive a rental one way and I would be home by now."
819,trustpilot.com,"Terrible, stressful, unhelpful pretty much sums it up. There were no windows at a major train hub and only one kiosk which had a line and didn’t work. An Amtrak worker told all 30 of us to call 1-800-USARAIL to get some code. After being on hold for an hour and nearly missing our train, the code didn’t work anyway. Really a terrible and inefficient system."
820,trustpilot.com,I take Amtrak frequently and most of the time it is a good trip. A highly recommend the Northeast Corridor.👍🏼  Some staff are rude but most are pretty nice people. I will definitely take Amtrak again. Because what other options are there in the USA for train travel?
821,trustpilot.com,"the MENTAL 8170 agent at Amtrack. (you don’t deserve a job in costumer service) when my train got canceled i went to costumer service window to get help. And if you think racism goes only one way you’re wrong. now i’m white and the representative made it clear that was personal. not only she informed me that the 10:20 train (3h later) was sold out and there where no seats, but after i got a refund and asked what’s the next train available she said 10:20 and she can no longer assist me because i asked for a refund. she starting gesticulating how she’s so upset and when i asked to talk to her manger she stood up and put a closed panel in front of the window. i’m wandering if all amtrack employees are MENTAL! of course a manager was able to help right away."
822,trustpilot.com,"with kids in college, in California coastline.Last time I took the train I had to take my service dog, which is a challenge in and of itself. I was taking the route from Union Station to LA to San Luis Obispo. I am taking the time to write the review of the staff including the food cart gentleman. The staff is always there to assist. The train is quiet. Easy to navigate on. And very enjoyable."
823,trustpilot.com,"Last weekend my husband and I traveled to New Rochelle and he left his cpap machine on the train. We initially could not reach anyone to assist us to locate it. The next morning, Eric Sullivan from the New Haven, CT station called me to let me know it was found. He worked with me to figure out the best way to ship it to our home. The process of return was simple and it even arrived a day before we were quoted. I appreciate Eric's attention to detail and willingness to walk us to the steps to get this much-needed piece of medical equipment returned."
824,trustpilot.com,"There is a Quiet Zone in the town where I live.  The Amtrak trains regularly blow their horns in this quiet zone.  First negative.  When I wrote to tell them about this the customer service representative obviously did not read my comment and sent back a canned PSA about how they are allowed to sound X distance from the crossings.  Read what I wrote, don't respond to what you think I wrote.  Negative two."
825,trustpilot.com,It’s a good train ride .. it is a tricky website if your a senior.   The website DIES NOT DEFER TO SENIOR PRICING unless you say no adult is traveling .   NOT NICE TO ABUSE A SENIOR WITH A INEFFICIENT CATEGORY!!!
826,trustpilot.com,I love traveling on Amtrak and have been on nearly every route over the years. My first trip I packed a book but I was so busy enjoying the scenery that I never really read it. Since Amtrak doesn't own the rails they travel on I always allow for them to be majorly late if they get hung up by freight traffic. I always feel safer traveling by train. It's too bad that they don't get adequate funding by Congress. They have to constantly make cuts year after year to try to become profitable but don't think any national railroad in the world is profitable. That's why Amtrak was formed- the freights got out of the passenger business because they were losing money. After 9/11 Amtrak and the bus was the only way to travel and I wish Congress wouldn't forget this. The lack of funding has had a bad effect on the food service and of course the equipment is way too old.
827,trustpilot.com,"Review is for Chicago to dc 7 Jan 2020.  This is my last time. It’s that bad. Caress hot as hey, I kept having to get up and go to the observatory car to cool off. Nasty snack bar I got scolded for setting my cape on the counter cuz of the food and all. So I sit down to eat my nasty bagel and the dude starts staying cleaner while I’m eating.  They have no refrigerator for use nor microwaves so you have only eat cold food. The crew for the most part have been good but they got their rude puppies"
828,trustpilot.com,I purchased an Amtrack ticket from Philadelphia to west palm beach. We used a Amtrack employee to book our trip . The employee did not tell us that there were two trains one that stops in Tampa out of the way and another that does not stop in Tampa. The one I took  stopped in Tampa . When it stopped in Washington DC instead of picking up the extra engine  which was protocol according to the staff on the train it only picked up one engine . This engine broke down in Virginia for over 6 hours. The conductor told me that two of those hours were spent figuring out what to do . They should have a plan in place .  They didn’t infirm us exactly our new time of arrival .to our destination.  They had one attendant on the train for food and he took breaks close to meal times for the  food car . So everyone had to stand in a long line to purchase food and drink. Which involved you be subjected to the coach people who were drunk half of them.  Not behaving . The food service   Train was taken away so your stuck for over 24 hours eating garbage like hot dogs . They should have separate food for sleeper cars like they do  for the  auto train. People don’t eat garbage food like that they want healthy food salads and fresh fruit . I luckily packed my own food  I had read a review about the food before leaving. Then it happened the last 8 hours  the smell of poop coming thru the vents . I find out in coach all the toilets were over flowing and it was a hot mess in the coach car . They should of been cleaned at one of the stops . I was lucky I had a sleeper bed room  with my own bath room. Which I locked and drew the curtains for my safety . The attendant was non existent and told me not to wake her in the morning because she sleeps late . Apparently she didn’t sleep enough because she was tired and should of been relieved from her job . Amtrack could have done something for the sleeper people moved us to a bus in Orlando so that we could of had our  vacation day back . Nope they carried us all to Tampa and we had no idea we were even going to Tampa most of us were not informed. So that we got in at 11:40 instead of four in the afternoon .  I won’t get on a smelly gross Amtrack long distance ever again !!! The service was awful and the people scary and the train smells like bowl movements. They can’t handle a engine failure . They don’t make it right . They could help you get off the train and find alternative transportation so you don’t loose your car rental and  Destroy your vacation . Never ever will I go any further then four hours with Amtrak Fly don’t train it ! Rent a car drive down it’s much faster then getting in the train to Florida. Amtrak should not be allowed to travel over night and not provide descent meals. Airplanes provide meals when it’s overnight . How can you have people waiting in long lines at meal times buying hot dogs for two days . It’s nuts. You lost your charm taking away the dinning car. Your only a a moving  bathroom on wheels on a track being pulled by broken down rusty engine cars . No one should have to smell poop for eight hours . Fly people fly !!!  A refund wouldn’t even be pay back for this.  I want Amtrak to be looked at by the government for how they treat people and how they treat their employees.
829,trustpilot.com,"Avoid AmtrakTerrible service! Purchased tickets for the 26th December on the 24th December. On collecting my tickets, my husband and I noticed the date was carded for the 24th December, however, the agent (at Penn Station) assured us it would be viable. On the 26th December, my husband and I (both tourists) checked in our baggage and boarded our cabin. However, upon settling in, the attendant informed us that our tickets were invalid due to the date! After conversing with the conductor, it was determined that we would have to pay for new seats or vacate the train at another location. After conversing with an agent from support about our issue, he stated that we would be unable to get a refund and have to purchase new tickets ro remain on the train. Amtrak needs to revisit the competency of their employees as it can place alot of persons in trouble and danger. As such, I will never recommend or use their service in the future."
830,trustpilot.com,"Younger Information Gate agent at Amtrak South Waiting area Union  Station Chicago for Empire Builder On 12/12/19.  Gave information needed but was rather curt and unfriendly in his vinegar attitude , like he was sick of people.  Maybe he should seek other employment where he doesn’t have to deal with people.  How about loading baggage.Definately a poor Ambassador for Amtrak!"
831,trustpilot.com,"The Amrak is the most unreliable, inconsistent, and biggest joke of transportation I have come to find and I am a student in Chicago that uses public transportation as a part of my daily routine. Never take the amtrak train if you are on a schedule. I think its absurd especially in this day and age, for something used by numerous individuals for travel, to be so unreliable and inconsiderate of schedules. I support the amtrak company, and I buy a ticket from them at least once a month, and never once have I arrived to my destination on time, or even close to the time I was supposed to arrive. I support this company because there is no other option, and I believe that to be the reason that your staff and procedure does not cater to amtrak customers in an appropriate way. You guys KNOW you are one of the only affordable options for people, especially when traveling shorter distances."
832,trustpilot.com,Had a wedding I was in in MI. Was there on time and found out train was canceled. No staff was present at the train station so I was there by myself. Stranded. They didn’t offer any way for me to get to another station. Not willing to work with me. I MISSED THE WEDDING AND I CAN NEVER GET THAT BACK AND ITS ALL THEIR FAULT!!!!
833,trustpilot.com,"AWFUL!!  HORRIBLE!!  Chronically late and not just by a few minutes.  At least an hour, or 1 or even 3.  Worst experience ever!  Greyhound is better.

834,trustpilot.com,"This is the 2nd time that I have a bad experience with Amtrak. The first time I chalked it to them having a bad day. But after using them this past week, I come to believe that they just don't care about their customers. Not only did they change my times on my departure date not once but twice!! Then the day that I left from Ann Arbor to go to Kalamazoo, MI they train was 30 minutes late which made me late & inconvenienced the person that was picking me up in Kalamazoo.Then on the returned date leaving Kalamazoo, the train was once again 30 minutes late. Then every stop after that, they would stay like 10 min. or more longer which then in turn took longer to return to Ann Arbor. This in turned made me 30 minutes late getting to work. I am seriously ticked off at Amtrak for making my trip very unpleasant."
835,trustpilot.com,The Amtrak cancellation policy in practice is different than stated on their Website.  The 25% penalty on sleeping car reservation should apply only to that segment of a multi-segment trip.  Instead they apply it to the whole trip.  I would love to travel by train but wish that our nation's passenger rail system was in more capable hands.
836,trustpilot.com,"I have booked a trip, and I am trying to contact Amtrak to ask a question after reading all the information pages on the site.

Could not get an answer from Amtrak.  They kept pushing back the departure time but would not notify passengers.  Called numerous times and could not get an ETA.  Originally the train was scheduled to leave at 2pm. It was 10pm and could not still get an answer from Amtrak.  My hotel stay in New Orleans was non refundable and Amtrak would not reimburse lost money.
839,trustpilot.com,"At 7:14 AM, CST, I received an automated call regarding a change to our reservation.  I was prompted to press ""0"" if I had any questions which I did.  Twyla came on the phone dry as a bone and rude as a Bully!! Long Story short, (well not so short, 43 minutes & 4 seconds), Twyla made an attempt to verify my information and said Amtrak didn't call me. Then she said the reason for the call was because I didn't pay for our trip!!! Then she wanted the CC# that I used.  Mind you I was called, so why, oh why, would I give out my CC#? I pulled up my Confirmation info and gave it to TWYLA she put me on hold then came back with the same info that was sent to my email.  Since I needed more information and TWYLA was soooo rude I asked to speak with someone in authority and a better attitude. Her response was that ""I had an attitude"".  My response was ""bring one get one"". I was wrong for my response. Two wrongs don't make a right.  Meanwhile, on my landline, I called Amtrak and talked to Hardenia.  She was very apologetic and gave me all the information I needed.  Great job Hardenia! Mind you, I'm still on hold with TWYLA on my cellphone waiting for a supervisor. Lou with Customer Relations came on the line and he explained the situation and made me feel like my patronage was appreciated.  Thanks, Lou."

841,trustpilot.com,"The ride was bad from the start, the train kept being delayed by large intervals of time with no explanation. Once we got on, it was rushed and leg room was non existent on this service. The wifi was not functional, so during underground stops there wasn't anything. I go to the meal service and ask if it was possible to use Samsung Pay (which was compatible with their system), however, the attendant was rude and wouldn't let me attempt to use it. Their prices for a bag of chips were a lot more than they should have been."

843,trustpilot.com,"Several years ago (2015), my son and I took a look-see trip on the California Zephyr from Sacramento, CA to Grand Junction, CO. At Grand Junction we could get off at noon, have lunch in town (a delicious burger joint), and get on the West-bound train about 4 pm. We shared a roomette (overnight each way) so dining car meals were included and the food was good. Being the taller of us Ben got the lower bunk and I got the upper. It was pretty cramped if you are used moving your body during the night. We went during Winter so daylight was short, but there was a full moon and the weather was clear so even at midnight and beyond the dome car offered some spectacular views. The return from Grand Junction to Sacramento was an adventure most would rate as a disaster, whereas I found it exceedingly interesting and informative. The train we boarded was the one that had been stuck in a Midwest snow-drift for days. The food had been restocked in Denver, but plumbing was still frozen in some cars, and the crew was pretty grumpy. Most west bound passengers had decamped at Denver, so there were very few passengers. I figure that if you are going to ride Amtrak you have to be looking for adventure.So. I am planning a round trip adventure from Sacramento to Portland or Seattle (Coast Daylight/Starlight, then to Chicago on the Empire Builder, Chicago to New Orleans (City of New Orleans [Arlo Guthrie]),  then Sunset Limited from NOL to LAX, and LAX back to Sacramento. I expect this to be an adventure. I will not include my 40 year old son, so I will get the lower bunk. I will let you know how it turns out.John from Sacramento"
844,trustpilot.com,"I take the Amtrak every 2 weeks.  The last trip was really bad.  No Wifi is not acceptable.  It's a really big deal on a trip we pay $150 to take, over a full day.  Some trains to FL are run in a rough, raw group of ol' conductors who talk like they don't give a damn.  Ask to change seats to spread out and get comfortable-- and an old guy might ask you ""why didn't you pay for a sleeper""....  rude and dumb reply (Booze?  Don't really care, but how about taking it down a notch if someone wants to sit somewhere without being next to the fat lady who talks the entire time on her cellphone?)Other conductors are really great. But all in all when the Wifi is down, it's like a concentration camp ride.  Everyone goes bananas.   Fix the Damn Wifi so it works every single time!!!  We pay through the nose, right?"

847,viewpoints.com,"We took the train from Chicago to Provo and it was the most terrible travel experience I've ever had.  We arrived at our destination 15 hours late.  There was no compensation for the hotel room we missed out on let alone the time it took from our vacation.  The train was disgusting- the levers on the chairs were sticky, the floor was dirty, the bathrooms were completely unsanitary.  By the end of the trip there was urine all over the floors of the bathrooms & in the hallway area.  The entire train had a nasty smell & I was on the verge of puking from the smell for most of the train ride.  Our return trip was very similar to the way out.

Orlando in spring 2019. For such a distance I'm informed enough to give you this advice: don't ride Amtrak. In theory the train would be great. In practice it's awful. Loud people, rude conductors, outdated trains, cramped seats. 

For the love of all things holy fly to your destination! If it's more than one day on a train, drive! There are no benefits to taking the train and a cheap fare will cost your sanity in the end. If you don't want to drive and can't afford to fly, stay home! It's the universe telling you to."
849,viewpoints.com,"On a recent round trip from Washington, DC to Miami our initial trip was made pleasant by a young train attendant, Leo, who was friendly, courteous, and energetic, and who worked to make our trip enjoyable.  He helped us with our luggage and made sure we had access to juice and coffee all day. Unfortunately the sleeper compartments designed by an evil engineer are extremely uncomfortable and almost impossible to sleep in.  The return trip was very different, almost from the moment we entered the car.  A prominent sign displayed says that if a passenger has difficulty dealing with the AMTRAK facility to ask for help from the crew. Since we are seniors and I have a leg damaged by many surgeries, we requested help putting our luggage in the designated loft. Our train attendant, Vivian, immediately responded that she couldn't do it because she was a woman. I responded that we had to store at least one piece because the space was so cramped. She said she had had a hip replacement and couldn't do it. I responded that there must be some way since the previous attendant had done it. She asked who it was and said he had violated protocol and put pressure on her and other employees against the rules. She said we shouldn't have brought so much luggage (one piece each). She then left and returned with a supervisor complaining about us and Leo's action. The supervisor offered nothing and left. She avoided work throughout the trip and refused to make coffee except once in the morning ""because of protocol"".  We feel if she can't do her job because of disability she should be in a different position."

And we might have changed our minds if the return service had been better, but it was just as bad if not worse.  They ran out of food both lunches we had.  We were in a roomette and supposed to receive free dining room food.  However, both times they ran out of our choices but made no attempt to voucher us for the snack car.  We demanded it on the return trip and went there to have frozen pizza from the microwave and hot dogs.  The whole crew were rude and unapologetic."

We asked if they were going to put us up for the night and were told they don't do that. So myself my 80 year old mother and her friend had to sit in Penn Station until the next morning. On the way home the same thing we missed a connecting train in New Haven CT so instead of waiting my husband drove from Orang Ma to New Haven CT to pick us up. I know this review in no way will help us but we hope it will help others to make other plans. The rating on this review would not allow me to give no stars.
854,viewpoints.com,learned that amtrak was way too exspensive paid 184$ from ny to newark delaware when i could of paid 77$ with greyhound shame
855,viewpoints.com,"Just took the California Zepher from Chicago to Emeryville, CA. This was our 1st overnight train trip.
PROS: The scenery was amazing. It had snowed in Colorado which was beautiful. The rockies, rivers, salt flats, Donner Lake, etc. was breathtaking.  We enjoyed our sleeper bedroom with a bath and we happy we had chosen it. The food was good and there were a lot of choices.

CONS: Our cabin attendant, Davon, responded promptly on the 1st and 2nd day of our trip. He prepared our beds and brought us ice.On the last day he never came to our cabin. We had already given him a $20 tip and was planning to give him $20 more.  My husband went to dining for ice and was 1st told they did not have any ice, then another employee found him a bag of ice- he tipped him $5.  Our cabin was not cleaned during our trip. Even the overflowing trash can was not emptied. Maybe this is NOT part of the steward's duties.  Some of the dining car attendants were friendly and polite. One of the ladies was most rude to me - even guests sitting with us said she was rude. The next day at dinner which was being served because our train was 6 hrs late getting into Emeryville. This same lady gave us a lecture on how they were not even suppose to give us dinner, but had to since the train was late. I think she was trying to explain why they only had certain items available but it came across to all four of us that we should be grateful we were getting a meal!
Since we had a five hr. delay in Denver, we did not get to see Glenwood Springs, which was suppose to be one of the highlights of the trip. Many folks were very unhappy that the train was running so behind in the schedul.
Overall our 1st trip was most enjoyable. However, the personnel need public relations training to make this a five star trip!"
856,viewpoints.com,"The Zephyr ride from Denver to Salt Lake City was supposed to be fast and breath taking with the trees turning, but was a boring ride through the western plains of Wyoming.  It looked just like our Oklahoma west with sage brush and plateaus.  We did see 2 antelope and a herd of about 25 bison that was penned up close to the tracks.  The speedy Zephyr stopped about every 5 miles to let another train to clear the tracks!!  It was a very disappointing trip!!!"

						Amtrak has a rating of 1.68 stars from 50 reviews, indicating that most customers are generally dissatisfied with their purchases. Reviewers complaining about Amtrak most frequently mention  customer service problems. Amtrak ranks 699th among Travel Other sites.					"
858,sitejabber.com,"They were amazing. Not only is it a smooth ride there was also nice and sweet. There was a mud slide causing a huge delay. Amtrak ended up putting us in a beautiful hotel, giving a $200 voucher for next visit AND gave us soo many free meals due to the inconvenience that wasn't their fault. I do recommend using Amtrak. I definitely will again."
859,sitejabber.com,It is incredible the high cost we pay for a roomette it's even higher than a five star hotel sometimes and yet they have no time to wash the rugs on board train 97 southbound. The good news is the dining car is open now and you can enjoy the nice food on board again. The room attendant was a sweetheart. Amtrak is not a cheap travel alternative and travelers clean areas at all times.
860,sitejabber.com,Was really excited to take a train ride instead of flying from Seattle to Vancouver. Lined up in Seattle. Got there early. Conductors tell out numbers that nobody know what they mean. People confused. We get onboard and all the seats are taken. No instruction of what to do next. Finally they open up another car. Whole process makes no sense. Disorganised and stressful. Food sub par. Starbucks drip coffee tasted like it was brewed the week before. Once we arrived in Vancouver we sat on the train for another hour with no reason other than they had to take checked bags off. Absolute disgrace of a transit service. Will never travel on Amtrak again.
861,sitejabber.com,My secretary forgot to enter my rewards number to my booked ticket. I have been on hold now for 30 minutes listening to the WORST Muzak from Amtrak along with the worst voices pushing Amtrak's credit cards. It's late and I'm tired and I have to deal with this poor customer service. I also want to add a companion ticket which will no doubt be a smooth process. Hate Amtrak and their DC lounge sucks!
862,sitejabber.com,Tip for consumers:If Amtrak had a competitor they’d be out of business.
863,sitejabber.com,Absolutely awful. Have been stuck on the train in the middle of nowhere for 4 hours after the train got delayed by 3 before departing. Even tho it's a cheaper option it definitely shows and I don't think I'll ever be taking a train again. Awful customer service with quality and service from 300 years ago.
864,sitejabber.com,"They do not give a single $#*! about your time or schedule. They play by their own rules and make up the timing. What should have been a roughly 24 hour trip is now easily reaching 40. All because of waiting for a staff change, or using the same route as many freight trains. Absolutely unacceptable and I will never use Amtrak to travel again."
865,sitejabber.com,Tip for consumers:SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY AND AVOID AMTRAK
866,sitejabber.com,Products used:Couldn't even take a shower. Didn't get to use any products.

868,sitejabber.com,"Conductor in New London CT this morning was sarcastic when I asked a question. Intercom speakers DO NOT WORK, bunch of LOUD crackling. Absolutely no one available to ask where we are. If there's a Cafe, haven't a clue? Packed in like sardines and was hoping once we reached NYC the train would empty a bit, not the case. Truly wish I spent the extra cash to fly."
869,sitejabber.com,Started chatting online on their web page. Shaquil seemed to have fallen asleep right after introducing himself. Then called their customer service line to speak with a human being. She wasn't able to answer my simple questions about pricing and kept asking me to hold until I got tired of holding and ended the call. Called back hoping to speak with another agent. The 2nd agent would not even let me finish my sentence and constantly interrupted. Never experienced worse customer service.
870,sitejabber.com,The bathroom broke down and one was just locked so we had to walk all the way to the next cabin. On top of that my stop was the next stop was supposed to be there at 10:44 pm and had a 2 hour delay because a driver needed some sleep come on now I'm very disappointed get off at the stop go in to buy a drink and the pop machine broken
871,sitejabber.com,When the fuel lines on my weedwhacker were destroyed by gasoline I thought I would have to throw the unit away. Being able to get an exact replacement tank I now have operational piece of equipment for many years to come.

873,sitejabber.com,"This company is a fraud.

I booked a $509 trip back in June 2022 (with the travel protection policy making sure my tickets were refundable should I cancel).

Cancelled trip July 2022. We are going into October and I still haven't seen a dime of my money back.

They issued me a cash refundable eVoucher but refuse to give me my cash back. The representatives are all RUDE on the phone. Pretend not to hear you when the call.

They closed out my online tickets to contact them via email without addressing the issue.

Do not travel with this fraudulent company."
874,sitejabber.com,"A friend and myself wanted to get away for a few hours without driving. We were only going 30 miles North. A few minutes from our destination we stopped and sat for nearly 30 minutes waiting for a Southbound train to pass. Instead of having 2 hours at our destination, we only had 1 1/2. If this happens every day to this train, they should tell the public up front."
875,sitejabber.com,"Train cancelled & stranded in Chicago with no other train options 3/25. Had to stay an extra night in the hotel and rent a car to drive back 8 hours 3/26. We spent over $600 to get home when our train tickets were $120 total. We could have flown back home with tickets easily under $150 each if we booked when we initially scheduled the trip. We chose to take the train back home to enhance our journey and have a relaxing journey home. This turned into a nightmare when Amtrak cancelled 3 hours before departure, all other train options were booked or cancelled, all flights were either booked or $500 per ticket and no car rentals were available until the next day. The relaxing train journey turned into an extra $600 expense with 8 hours of driving.

Amtrak was not able to provide any assistance during the day the train was cancelled. Tickets were refunded and told to call Monday when Customer Service is open. Called Monday & waited on hold for over an hour. Customer service offered $100 voucher for use within 1 year & directed me to contact corporate via email for a response in 6-8 weeks. Customer rep advised that they do not have a supervisor when asked to speak with someone above them. Rep advised that only method for going forward is contacting corporate.

I no longer feel comfortable traveling with Amtrak in the future now that I know the customer service response. Amtrak will do nothing or will not provide any assistance if you are stranded. They do not care. Would leave a 0/5 stars if possible."
876,sitejabber.com,"I was not informed there is no business class cross country travel after I paid for it when they bumped us down. So my son and I are stuck in economy for TWO DAYS! Then I get a call we are being moved. Yet! When I ordered the tickets I checked and it showed business was offered for the travel when I was ONLINE which I selected after I VERIFIED IT WAS OFFERED. Thanks a lot for the deception. I noticed that we have business class now with reduced fare for the last 6 whopping hours of our trip. What's the point. The other 35 hours we have no access to ANYTHING let alone the ability to be comfortable, or eat move about in comfort with my 10 year old now, this was SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE FOR HIM! Your company RUINED HIS VERY FIRST TRIP ON A TRAIN THAT I EAS PERSONALLY EXCITED TO TAKE HIM ON! YOU ALL ARE A BUNCH OF HEARTLESS DECEPTIVE JERKS! Thanks a lot Amtrak. We will NEVER ride a train again. We will take a bus for what you charged at least we can recline to sleep."
877,sitejabber.com,Tip for consumers:I will be contacting the BBB with all of my information I downloaded and saved. They reduced my ticket price to bump us down to economy. I have ALL OF IT as well as the CREDIT CARD STATEMENT.

880,sitejabber.com,This guy is horrible how does he have employment with Amtrak? He was so rude to me. I walked in the snack shop I ask for a hot chocolate. The guy said $2.50 I handed him my bank card. He responded the machine has been down since yesterday. I replied he should have a sign up saying cash only. In front of other customers Lavae started shouting at me saying that I need to go somewhere else and talk. Then he yelled at me like I was his child and told me to shut up. I'm on this train for 35 hours. WHO Carrie's cash these days nobody does. This guy had me shaking trying to walk back to my seat. I can't wait to depart this Amtrak train. I will never ride this crap again. Customer service is lower than the dirt on the ground. What makes this issue even worse. This was an over grown man so you know he knew better. Ignoramus is the name for you Lavae guy behind the counter in the kitchen on Sunday coming from Kansas City going to LA. I told you I would report you Lavae and I'm not done … I'm sick of these companies taking your money and having no people skills it's time out for this. When you know better you do better Amtrak needs to get rid of this guy asap.
881,sitejabber.com,"A white shirt employee was beyond rude on the Palmetto 90. He wouldn't assist an older lady with her bag. His response ""how heavy is it?"" Didn't give her a chance to respond & just walked off."
882,sitejabber.com,"Tampa.staff was great. But the employees on train seems like they all hate their jobs. They are rude, and have no people skills. Their just not nice to people generally. It's a shame when a 7 yr old can watch the poor attitudes and disgraceful customer service towards people. Put a smile on your face and be nice, there is no need to be rude to everyone, just because you chose this direction. It's not our fault.
On a safety note. I am a safety director. Slip trips and falls. Pick up the trash on the floor instead of walking over it. Clean the bathrooms, quit spreading germs around. There is no reason for any of this. You have plenty of time. Besides all that, my granddaughter had a good time."
883,sitejabber.com,The worst experience ever! 6 hours in train to NYC right now and still don't know when We get back? Very bad service. None care of passengers. Never again.
884,sitejabber.com,"33 hours from Fargo to Seattle… got a roomette due to distance and bought round trip tickets. My disabled son went with me. Roomette is too small to stay in. I was on top bunk and the ceiling was 5 inches from my face. A lot of jerky movement constantly made it tough to sleep on that top bunk anyway. My son fell twice due to being tossed around like a pinball trying to get to the dining car. Could barely walk to and from the bathroom due to the train swaying and jerking so much. Food was really good but not worth the extra $1200 I spent to upgrade from coach. Observation car windows were filthy. Could barely see out of them. Bathrooms were filthy. Attendant enroute home was really nice, but many of the staff were crabby and acted like they didn't want to be there. Can't blame them. We can unfortunately say now that we rode on a train. We could have flown for less money than that roomette. Lesson learned."
885,sitejabber.com,"Delayed and delayed and delayed, no estimate timeline. Bad communication and keep us waiting and waiting forever. When try to get any refund, they deducted fee and its not our fault train delayed for over 2 hours. The worst train system ever!"
886,sitejabber.com,They have no return policy they keep your money fraudulent they are absolutely scanners anyone that keeps your money is a scammer there is no other options I have tried over and over no response except all we don't return if that's not a scam then what is
887,sitejabber.com,"In this day and age of inelegant air travel as Alec Baldwin recently quipped... train travel is a wonderful option.

Admittedly it is not the same gracious experience as it once was; however, there are many lovely aspects to rail travel: spacious seating, watching the cityscapes and rural scenery float by, generosity in regard to luggage and many more.

Some reviewers cite the uncleanliness in bathrooms, but this is due to lack of good manners on behalf of other travelers who have poor aim and are generally slothful by nature.

I travel from Point A to Point C on a regular basis --- with a long layover at Point B, which happens to be a fabulous city. I look forward to these jaunts... and they do not cost an arm and a leg for the price of a one-way fare.

Wifi is spotty... so I read or take paperwork. I break up the time with a trip to the Cafe Car -- their fare is not bad at all.

My main concern is the usage of the Quiet Car. But once again; it is fellow travelers failing to observe normative courtesy who disturb the peace for others.

Four stars, Amtrak."
888,sitejabber.com,Amtrack has the worst attitude employees in the world and these trains are never clean and 3 hours late to destination
889,sitejabber.com,I wanted to change my reservation to get on the train ONE stop later that reserved. 15 min later at the next stop. They said only if I paid $296 extra. I was told this on more than one phone call. Total scam.
890,sitejabber.com,Recently I was able to break away for a weekend back in my home and away from work. I have used Amtrak a few times to do this same trip. The website is user friendly and easy to navigate for me. The prices are very reasonable and tickets easy to get. The trip went well but was delayed slightly due to the recent bad weather in the Midwest. As this is not a long trip I usually travel coach. The room and comfort is very good and the ride very smooth. The only issue I would really bring up is the cleanliness of the restrooms and occasionally the cars themselves. The attendants could be a bit more observant of those things and remedy the situations easily. This is not a serious issue by any standard but more of an improvement that is easily made to improve the overall service. I will definitely ride again. Good value and good service but the food is very high priced.
