7,yelp.com,"Amtrak has always been a reliable transportation for me to get to NYC from Boston. Its clean, has comfortable coach seats and the customer service is awesome. I lost my wallet during a trip from NY to BOS, I ran to the ticketing booth to see if they could help me contact the conductor. Danielle from the ticketing booth was able to contact the conductor, Dan, and they were able to help me find my wallet! They were incredibly nice and understanding. 10/10 would always recommend taking the Amtrak from BOS to NYC."
8,yelp.com,"Not a bad way to head to New York or Philadelphia if the price is right and if everything runs on time - both of which are big ifs. The Acela trains are generally the fastest option between Boston and New York since you don't have to wade thru traffic on both ends in getting to the airport. They're also reasonably comfortable inside, with seats that offer enough width and leg room so that you can get things done on your laptop or snooze cozily. They can be just as - if not more - expensive than flying, but you can get good deals if you can buy more than 14 days beforehand. They're not truly ""high-speed"" in a European sense, though, and the ""business class"" cabin is similar to what would be 2nd-class in Europe. The Northeast Regional trains are slower, not just because they might stop at more stations, but also because they can be deprioritized behind Acela and freight trains - so delays can cascade dramatically. Coach-class seats have better legroom than planes but are still anything but glamorous, especially if everyone around you is yakking on their phones. All this having been said, they're usually cheaper than Acela trains. Again, if everything runs on time and you can get a reasonably priced fare, Acela is definitely the way to go to New York or Philly. It still takes too long to get to DC, though, so flying is much faster and usually cheaper."
9,yelp.com,"Rotting on stopped Amtrak California Zephyr. No idea when trip will resume. Conductor chimes in occasionally with jokes, apparently thinks it's funny. Buyer beware...this is third world stuff."
10,yelp.com,"Amtrak is one of my favorite ways to travel. Either between Boston and Providence or to NYC. Why drive when you can sit and enjoy the ride? No traffic to deal with, cold beverages and snacks at your leisure, restrooms etc. To me, Amtrak travel is a no brainer. I suggest booking your tickets as soon as you can because the price is often wayyyy cheaper when there is plenty of time before your trip. Tickets can sometimes double if not triple in price if you wait for the last minute."
11,yelp.com,"Overall, the Acela experience to and from PHL to BOS was very pleasant.  On the way up, the experience was nearly perfect with helpful staff. I opted for the QUIET car, which, for the most part, was observed.  The wifi was strong and there was  plug if you needed to power up any electric gear.  The seat was comfy. It was really cold in there with the AC blasting, but glad I had a jacket to keep me warm.On the way back, it was just slightly less pleasant, not all of Amtrak's fault.  I hadn't had a chance to eat, so after settling in to my seat and waiting a while, I headed up to the club car to get some snacks. The guy working there was really rude, almost yelling, ""I'm not open yet!""  Well, the next sentence should have been, ""Come back in XXXXX AMOUNT OF TIME!""  Instead, he made a shooing motion to go away.  When I tried to ask when I should come back, he literally turned his back on me and walked away.  OKAY.Otherwise, the experience was quite nice."
12,yelp.com,"Recently the NE regional has been abysmal with delays in excess of 2 hours even under optimal weather conditions. Given the price point (often hundreds of dollars between Boston and New York), consider driving or walking"
13,yelp.com,"Yo, can any IT person fix the wifi on these trains in coach in NEC? Us peasants need the free internet.  I think I took the Acela once from Boston to NYC Penn station and had no problems. Seats are comfortable and the train is fairly on time. Too bad we don't have high speed bullet trains like Japan. Definitely beats taking a flight since there's no TSA check-in, but you also have the drawback of no seats in south station to really wait for the train. There's pigeons flying everywhere inside the station ready to snatch your mcnuggets out of your grubby hands. Nothing fancy on the cafe train. Maybe the business class got steaks and lobster but then it'd be like snowpiercer the movie."
14,yelp.com,"My first experience with Amrak and it was fine.  I am a fan of public transportation in big cities, having taken subways and buses.  It was a little confusing knowing which train and which track, so we had to ask, but it got us where we needed to be.  We had round-trip spots to and from Boston and New London, CT.The guys who scanned our tickets after we were seated were very personable and helpful with questions."
15,yelp.com,"after a decade in Europe, this touted 150mph rail line for the NE corridor, is a joke. I don't think it travelled more than 6omph.  The ticket price I paid was $800 for first class. WOW. I could purchase a first class air line ticket for that price. the stations are dark and dirty, noisy, announcements are screamed so loudly to be not understandable. On the train there was a ticker that had a warning as if it was in a war zone. Maybe they could announce the stations instead, as the stations are not signed. why was this Acela stoping so frequently? slowed to a crawl through stations. the AC made the ride seem as if one was in a ice box. Interior not modern at all with big overstuffed chairs. this was not much faster than the regular train, so why all the hype?"
16,yelp.com,"So I haven't been on an Amtrack in a very long time. I was in Boston and needed to get to Philadelphia and my partners said ""don't go back to the airport take Amtrack Acela"" and since they were the locals I said okay. So the price was about the same as doing a AA flight out of Logan to Philly and the car was reasonable but the ride is just too long.  It was a 9:10am that arrived in Philly at 2:05pm.  This is just long....now if I was in NYC and needed to go to Philly for sure i would do it.This is a slow train because it just stops alot and at least there is Wifi that is fine for email but you cannot stream. Not in a hurry go for it.  NYC to Phily for sure, but Boston to NYC/Philly/WA it is just too long."

28,yelp.com,I wanted to change my reservation to get on the train ONE stop later than reserved. 15 min later at the next stop. They said only if I paid $296 extra. I was told this on more than one phone call. Total scam.
29,yelp.com,"It had been a couple of years since I last took an Amtrak train ride, and it seemed like the best option for me at the time, as I was making last minute travel plans while in Boston. I could not WAIT to leave my nightmare of a hotel so I just jumped online and found the next trip out of the city, purchased my ticket online, called a cab, and disappeared into the ether mid-day, even though I had already paid for my room for the night.I ended up booking a single traveler, privacy room from Boston to Washington, DC, and it was so comfy that I am secretly planning my next trip via Amtrak as I type this. I can't wait to get on the road again!Especially now, during the pandemic, it's really nice to not have anyone sitting next to you, getting up and down and generally being a distraction. It just so happened that I had my super comfy sleeping bag with me in my hiker's backpack, so I crawled right into it and enjoyed the luxury of the Amtrak trip. It's much, MUCH simpler than schlepping through the airport and through TSA, so I would highly suggest to anyone traveling during these uncertain times of Covid-19, to seriously consider booking your trip on the lovely Amtrak. YAY!!"
30,yelp.com,"I wish I could write a good review on Amtrak but the attitude of the employees and subarctic weather in the cars won't allow. I'm wasting my time here and will continue to be amazed and astounded by these classy people for many years to come. Way to go Amtrak, the pride shows in your work."
31,yelp.com,"++ Amtrak in Boston's South Station is a central location, accessible by bus, MBTA, and of course, Amtrak. You can get to anywhere you need to on the northeast US coast, and also in the city of Boston via South Station. + Amtrak provides a mobile app for ticket scanning, - decently clean seats (could be cleaner), ++ a café car, and friendly train conductors.  ++ If you've read this review up to now, your reward is now a pro cost-saving tip for anyone trying to move items cross country... AMTRAK FREIGHT SHIPPING. I shipped 306 lb of items from Boston across the country. Pricing in early 2020 is as follows: the first 1-50 lb is 85$; 51-100 lb is $95 and then additively 0.95/lb for anything 100lb+. You can't ship electronics or glass items, and no box can be over 50 lbs (they do weigh it before you pay). Payment is based on the total weight of the boxes you plan on shipping. The office hours are great, 8 AM - 7:30 PM on 7 days/week.++ Amtrak has a phone line that you can use to inquire about this service. This phone line is the only way you can get information about this service - minimal information is found on the web. The phone line folks told me my items would be palletized prior to loading onto a train. Palletization means that all your boxes get wrapped together and attached to a wooden slat and moved via forklift all at once. Decent.- The individual at South Station's Amtrak Freight Shipping office was a new kind of rude that I had not yet encountered. Keep in mind there was nobody else in line or waiting for this service. It was early morning, pretty quiet.  He informed us that my items would not be palletized, and gruffly informed to adjust the weights on our boxes as they were about 3 lb over in 1 box. The concern with not palletizing boxes in my opinion is that there is a higher chance one might separate from the rest, and might get damaged during the move. On top of that was the fact that this was simply the opposite of what we had been told about the Amtrak Freight Shipping service via phone line. Kinda bummed that Kevin was the last Bostonian I encountered before I left this storied city. Hope he's doing well tho. - There is no tracking on your items that are shipped, everything is very manual and does not seem to be very electronic - I guess this is why costs are low? Make sure you buy some insurance on your items, although nobody ever really wants to be dragged into the tedious process of getting insurance payout on damaged or lost items. Insurance is $1 per $100. ++ I dropped my stuff off late January and it arrived across country on early February in about 5 days! I had been told that a cross country move would take 4 days but up to 8-9 days due to winter and trains having to make a detour due to weather. The destination station of your items will give you a call when your items arrive. If you don't pick it up after 48 hrs of arrival to the destination, they charge $5/box/day."
32,yelp.com,"Unless you have been living under a rock for the past seven years, I am sure you have figured out my love for trains. As a frequent rider of Amtrak, I had never gotten to ride the Northeast Corridor from wire to wire (Boston to Washington, DC) until just this very moment. Riding the train between both of these cities is an exhausting, yet an exhilarating adventure that I encourage everybody to do, at least once, no matter what direction. But if you do it, do it riding the Acela. It is a much faster, more manageable trip than if you ride the Northeast Regional, which is great if you plan on starting or ending your trip in New York. Anything longer might wear you down. But I went wire to wire, city to city, departing at 11:55 am and arriving into the District just before 7 pm. There is something romantic about the train that you just cannot get from flying. The beautiful Connecticut coastlines pass you by as blue as the sky, the fall foliage in the back drop just a flicker in your eye as you zoom through Rhode Island at 150 mph, crossing the iconic Hell Gate Bridge as you make a dramatic entrance into New York City, all make for an unforgettable experience. That is not including flying through New Jersey through long stretches at 135 mph in addition to the cityscapes of Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore. Crossing the Susquehanna river always brings a tear to my eye because of how gorgeous and wide it is, even if you are only riding at 90 mph, because whether it is a clear day, rainy day, or a night only illuminated by the full moon, it is always special to make that crossing, like the great explorers crossing the seas into the great unknown, you too are crossing, but for a much smaller purpose. As you can see, this is why trains are important. They do more than just get you there, they get you there in style. Not in speed or glitz and glamour, but in a romantic, 19th century emotion that makes you not want to get off, but rather get back on and make another journey."

35,yelp.com,"This is a wonderful building and didn't disappoint my expectations of a train station. It is accessible from the street and the underground (we took the T from Quincy and it was easy to find). It was busy and organized. Huge ceilings and large windows let a lot of natural light in. The bathrooms were packed but there was a worker there cleaning up. There were plenty of places to get something to eat.Since my friends and I had a sleeper car, we were able to sit in the Amtrak's Acela lounge with complimentary drinks and snacks. (Tip, if you are unable to navigate the stairs, let the doorman know, there is a locked elevator around the corner they will give you access to.) They also let us know when it was time to board. I'm glad, because you couldn't hear the announcements well inside the lounge."
36,yelp.com,"Amtrak is the old reliable way to travel in Northeast corridor.   It shines when the airports are in a mess.  I waited 7 hours in Logan after my early morning flight got returned back to the gate after 1 hour on the tarmac.   Then, I endured 2 cancelled flights and no way to get back until late night due to weather.  I called Amtrak and they were running on-time and had room on the Acela in the late afternoon!    I walked out of Logan and took the Silverline to South Station - about a 15 mins ride and I was on my way home!It was a comfortable ride and I got back to NYC within 4 hours...   thanks Amtrak!"
37,yelp.com,"Had to take the Amtrak from Boston to New York after a horrible experience with Greyhound. While traveling, I was reminded why the train is the best mode of transportation between the two cities. The Northeast Corridor never has any issues, clean bathroom and decent food on board. The status of the train is clearly communicated though the app and the conductors are friendly and knowledgeable about their route. Seats are comfortable enough for sleeping and the drop down trays and outlets make it easy to work. The Amtrak internet is a little spotty, but it's free.Always try to book as early as possible to get the best price (sometimes tickets from Boston to NYC are as low as $100 round trip)"

49,yelp.com,"I looked forward to a relaxing day aboard a train from Boston's Back Bay station to Albany, New York and then a sleeping car to Cleveland, Ohio after a long but productive week visiting clients. I was not disappointed.I booked the Amtrak tickets online. Their website is kind of clunky and the information about the amenities aboard the trains limited. An upgrade is in order. A handful of short videos that shows riders what to expect would go a long, long way to improving the experience.Train 449 from Boston to Albany was superb. A few passengers continuing via sleeper car were pulled aside and seated in what seemed to be a business class car near the front of the train. Maybe that was included in the price of the ticket but, if so, that wasn't obvious to me when I purchased the ticket and it wasn't indicated on the printout of the ticket.Seating was incredibly comfortable. Tons of leg room -- far more than you get when flying first class -- and plugs and free wifi throughout the train. Being able to stand, walk around, and visit with friends make for a pleasurable, stress free experience. The conductors were friendly and clearly had a passion for rail.Upon arrival in Albany we moved into the nice, clean station for maybe 30 minutes while the train was reconfigured. I heard that the train from Boston is literally merged with the train from New York and the combined train then continues west to Chicago with stops in a handful of cities including my destination of Cleveland.The sleeper car was great as was the sleeper car attendant, Alfred. He was friendly, eager to please, and seemed to really enjoy making the travel experience a pleasure for the riders. The cabins was roughly four feet wide, eight feet long, and 10 feet high. There were two seats, a sink, and a toilet. The seats converted into a single bed and a second single bed lowered from the ceiling with the end result being like a bunk bed. Alfred did a nice job of showing me the various amenities and talking through what I could expect after I boarded and then converted my seats into the bed when I was ready.Dinner in the dining car was included. There were roughly 10 tables with each setup for four passengers. No reservations were necessary. You just showed up, were seated, ordered, and your cooked-to-order meal then served. I was traveling alone and so could have been seated with others if there wasn't room but I ended up alone at the table. That was fine with me as I was in the midst of watching a movie on my laptop. There were some other tables were strangers shared a table and every single one of them seemed to enjoy the experience. Lots of laughter and friendships made.I wouldn't hesitate to repeat the experience. It was fun, relaxing, and a great experience."
50,yelp.com,"Utter trash, 2 guaranteed trips, 2 refunds. Do not guarantee travelling when not having the ability to do so. Had to wait in the south Boston station for hours during the 1st day then next day, just to go get a hotel room since by no choice getting stranded. Fuck Amtrak and their CEO, executives with power to make major decisions. I do not blame the employees but their higher ups."
51,yelp.com,"$300 + to travel from Stamford to Rte 128 on a Sunday morning?  Assigned seating is a joke. When I got to my seat, someone was sitting in it. Conductor told me to sit wherever I wanted. . Where should I sit in the age of Covid? i told him the rules are Amtrak's not mine. They assign the seats. He told me there's something wrong with the app. Sorry. Not my fault. Your job to fix it.  Come on! Trains are great. Being a conductor is a cool job. Try doing it."
52,yelp.com,"After venturing through the subterranean lair that is New York's Penn Station, the sight of a well lit and spacious train station was great to say the least!  The ride from New York to Boston was uneventful and I was pleased that I was able to grab a spot in the 'Quiet Car'.  The scenery along the way was just awesome and if you are not pressed for time, I highly recommend hoping aboard the Northeast Regional for the 4 hour journey to Bahstun.  It is cheap, fun and relaxing."
53,yelp.com,"I was boarding my train from PVD to BOS, Acela Express number 2164, Dec. 20th. 2019. During my boarding at PVD station I received racist profiling and profiling based on race by a black male first class conductor. I was trying to board the train, and held my iPhone on my hand showing the ticket in Apple Wallet. I showed the ticket to his face and showed my intention for boarding the first class train. However, despite the ticket in his face, he first asked me ""first class?"" and even after I pushed the ticket right in front of his face, he insisted ""are you first class on Acela 2164?"" I answered yes and let myself in. After I was seated, I heard him asking the other white male conductor to double check my ticket. When I showed my ticket in front of his face for a solid 5+ seconds. If he couldn't read then I don't think he should qualify for this job as a FIRST CLASS conductor. He should be considered a safety hazard due to his inability to respect guests, refrain from racism/profiling, and read train tickets. Afterwards the actual ticket inspector came alone and respectfully examined my tickets, which is the 3rd time I showed my tickets to board this damn train.It would be one thing if I was dressed like a bum and trying to board the train, but even in such a case after I showed him my ticket I should be allowed to board without triple checking my tickets. And I was wearing a $300 custom made leather shoes, $700 Canada Goose jacket, $300 Bose headphone, $400 Tumi bag, and $1000 Rimowa carry-on case. I was dressed very respectful, and he still doubted that I paid for my seat on this train. Which lead me to my conclusion that it could only be a racist act since I am asian and looked young. I am not aware of any regulations stating 20ish people are forbidden from riding first class on Amtrak. I am a Platinum Medallion with Delta airlines, and I fly 50+ times and spends 15k+ on flights each year. No once any airline employee doubted my right to priority boarding or seating in first class after I show them my ticket/membership card. This experience with Amtrak has convinced me that I should avoid Amtrak whenever possible and never pay for a first class ticket again. Why would I spend $100 on a half hour journey for this level of service again?"
54,yelp.com,"This is a review for the Northeast Regional train from Boston South to DC (Not Acela). I went round trip.Train there left on time, and arrive an hour late. This was apparently due to engine trouble. I did not notice anything wrong. But, stuff does happen...Train on the way back was delayed... by 10 minutes, and arrived 10 minutes early. The train itself is very clean, and, even though I went Coach, the seats were comfortable, and had a lot of legroom. I say this even though I am not a small guy by any means. While business class does not have this, I was in the quiet car. This is great!! Though I never flew, I heard lots of horror stories in relation to the noise. Here, I could listen to my music through cheap,m non-noise-canceling headphones, stare out the window, and not be disturbed. Food is alright, good enough to get you through a long train ride, (they do take credit cards) If you want your own food... pack a lunch!Bathrooms are pretty clean, especially considering this is a train, and everything that does in stays there (a little out of sight). They can be a little odor, but nothing too heavy, neither from fragrance in the blue water, neither from what people put inside it...The only thing that was a little weird was that power kept going out somewhere around CT. However, doors, WiFi, some lights, and of course brakes, still worked. Aside from the lights, outlets, and AC turning off, you would not notice. Unlike in subways, there isn't any rapid deceleration. Also, trying to sleep in a coach class seat proved to be a challenge for me. But there were a lot of people in that train who slept just fine. (this was the trian headed back, one that left at 10 at night for Boston."
55,yelp.com,I love the train.. quick and easy. It is the surge pricing that Amtrak should be ashamed of. Why is one way on a holiday weekend $162.00. ONE WAY!!!! The prices are ridiculous it ranges anywhere from 75.00 to 215.00. One way.  I have taken that train for years... At one time it was $84.00 round trip. I get that times change but a flight should not be less expensive than a train ride. Amtrak should be regulated somehow. It won't happen but should.
56,yelp.com,"Traveling to Boston, I need to arrive at the South Station to be within walking distance for an appointment at The Harvard Club (two blocks away). The Amtrak website was down, I called the toll free number. Purchased my ticket, not problem. The ticket says ""New York Penn Station to BOS (South Station).""No, there is a problem! The train arrives in Boston at the BACK BAY STATION!?! Instead of a two block walk to my meeting, IT'S TWO MILES.Standing in a snow flurry at 16 degrees was not my plan. I finally caught a cab and made it to my meeting in about 15 minutes.The train was great, just not the toll free service. Cost me $12 for the cab ride."
57,yelp.com,"I need to use a walker for distances. An Amtrak employee in Boston saw me approaching the train and instantly offered to help me board the train, found me a ""disability"" seat and made sure I was comfortable. When my train left New York, a conductor asked if I needed any assistance, either right then or when I reached my destination.  As a result, he carried my bag and walker off the train when I got off and offered to walk me to the elevator, which was quite a distance. All the Amtrak people were very pleasant and accommodating. This wasn't my first Amtrak trip and I won't hesitate to use it again when necessary. It's great to know that my disability won't stop me from travelling!"
58,yelp.com,"The ACELA is the best way to get from Boston to NYC. It's 4 hrs door to door and way more reliable than flying. Sure the flight is only an hour but, the cab to and out of the airports, the extra time to go thru security, and the potential for weather delays in winter, make flying a much more stressful and generally slower option.IMPORTANT: Ride the Acela not the regular train. The Acela is a fast Business/First only express train. Splurge on first class if you can, they feed you a better meal than you get on the plane. The regular train service is uncomfortable and slow. The Amtrak staff is a mixed bag. You sometimes get great staff and sometimes some not so great Amtrak life timers.A word of advice If this is your first time, don't take the late night train into NY Penn Station, the NYP station turns into a hotel for the homeless at night and feels more unpredictable and scary than the rebel headquarters in the Terminator movies. This is not a good first impression of NYC to carry with you."

71,yelp.com,"Like most yelpers, I glide down the Amtrak tracks in an Acela train at a top speed of 150 mph on route to NYC. The journey starts off at South Station after having booked a reservation online (ranging from $100-$150 for business class). Head to a machine to print out your ticket, sign the top left and you're off. Takes less than five minutes. That is if you wrote down your confirmation number and didn't rely on technology to provide it when you swipe your card like the ones in Penn Station. Can you tell I've made this mistake before?Anyhow, hop onto a clean train (skip the first car unless you want to get snapped at for answering your phone, silent area), stake out a good seat and get settled. Feel free to kick up your legs, bust out your laptop or charge your phone cuz they've got an outlet per person. And unless you're a serious germaphobe, put away the Purell; the restrooms are clean. Gasp! For part of Connecticut the tracks hug the ocean. On the left side of the train on the way and the right side on the way back, you'll see gorgeous landscapes whizzing by. Pulling into the station at the predicted hour the dozen times I've rode the rails, and with the subway a few steps in reach there's really no reason to fly. Unless of course you enjoy waiting in those security lines."
72,yelp.com,"In general, I will always opt to take the Amtrak over buses or planes to travel in the Northeast, so if it weren't for the incident I had below, this would be a 4/5. I haven't had issues with delays though sometimes the bathrooms reek of urine by the time the train hits New York. I recently forgot a baggage on train when it got to South Station, and luckily the bag was found and returned to me. I was really happy about that, but also dismayed to find the bag completely rifled through, with several items - gifts I got from the holiday, chargers, leather gloves, a bra (?!) - missing. Because I got off at the terminal stop there's almost no chance that another passenger did this, and not a member of their staff over the 2 days it took them to tell me the bag was at South Station. So, thanks but seriously, give your staff some ethics training."
73,yelp.com,"I take Amtrak every other weekend. Last March, I broke my wrist. At first, I was able to receive assistance with lifting my bag by being placed on the train a bit earlier. A few weeks later I was told to wait and that there were conductors and staff on the train to help me. There was NO ONE on the train to help. I left my bag in the area for those with disabilities. The employee who told me there were staff on the train to help was sitting down and leaning back with legs spread wide open while saying this to me. For the first time, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in your customer service."

75,yelp.com,"I no longer travel on air in the Northeast Corridor.  Between the harassment gauntlet at TSA checkpoints, the sheer lack of courtesy and performance of US Air, the horrible delays in air transportation, having to pay for luggage, carry-ons, and almost breathing in airlines nowadays, rude and even misanthropic flight attendants, and having slave-ship seat space on crowded and smelly airplanes, Amtrak is a welcome change in today's otherwise exasperating transportation experience.  Both in Acela as well as the Amtrak Regional trains, the passenger space and comfort is at least double than that of passenger airplanes.  You have room to read and relax.  Stop by the snack car and get some munchies.  And relax and enjoy the view.  As a matter of fact, with the time in transportation to far away terminals, having to get in early for security gauntlet delays, sitting on the gate for an hour on FAA delays, and then schlepping home from another distant airport, Amtrak is a breeze.  Hands down.  The Acela I'm riding now, in addition, offers complimentary WiFi (US Air, stick it) and even awesome clam chowder by Legal Sea Foods.  What else can you ask for?"
76,yelp.com,"I am officially spoiled.  I can't imagine taking a bus to NY ever again after this truly luxurious experience.  I mean, the ticket prices are no joke, but once you're on the train you realize what that money buys you: a comfy seat that reclines, a footrest, a fold-down table, a traffic-free trip to your destination, a snack car at your disposal if you get hungry in the middle of the ride, a restroom, and my personal favorite... drum roll... electrical outlets conveniently located next to every seat!!  They don't even offer those on planes (except Virgin Atlantic I've heard, but it's defniitely uncommon)!  I plugged in my iPod while I watched a movie, as to not drain the battery, and also charged my cell phone.  How convenient!  Traffic is a non-issue, as is parking, the Amtrak takes you where you need to go and gets you there in relative style.  I took the Acela Express so I can't comment on the older trains, but it was a pretty great start and end to my weekend in NYC.  Like I said I've been spoiled, and unfortunately my wallet may see the unfortunate effects of this newest discovery, but so be it.  I highly recommend this method of travel!  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I still think it costs more than plane tickets to LA (ie Southwest has pretty cheap fares!), but it's a great option to have."
77,yelp.com,"I like it. I like it a lot. I definitely prefer the train. But whenever I ride Amtrak, I always have to come up with ""What I am paying extra $75 for"". Otherwise I feel that I wasted money. Because it only shaves 30min at most from bus ride, $75 is for 30min faster ride won't be a good reason for it.Here are my reasons : 1. More leg rooms. Between the seats are definitely wide than the bus. 2. I can read books without getting motion sickness.  than the bus. However,3. Being able to piss without stabilizing myself by pushing the wall with one hand and one foot like I do in Fung Wah bus.4. Because of reason #3, I don't have to wait til I arrive to the shitty Chinese buffet restaurant in Manchester CT for bathroom break.5. I can drink beer to make travel time fly or even fall asleep easier.6. Space is wide enough to open the laptop and work.7. No need to deal with traffic jam.So basically, I am paying $10 each for those benefits I value. What are yours?"
78,yelp.com,"I recently took the Amtrak Northeast Regional train between Boston and Providence. I was pretty impressed...the train was exactly on time going both directions, and it was a comfortable ride. Previously, I've had much worse luck with timeliness when using Amtrak in the Chicago area. I would definitely take Amtrak again to get to Providence and other nearby locations. However, I think I'll stick to the buses for travel between Boston and NYC just because of the extreme cost difference."
79,yelp.com,"Horrible customer service and a miserable riding experience. I tried an Amtrak route from Eugene OR to San Jose CA. The train was dirty - the bathrooms unacceptably so. The food offered on board was of worse quality than packaged convenience store food. The seats were not comfortable enough for their intended use (overnight rides). Our return trip was delayed repeatedly, and due to the uncertainty we ended up needing to rent a car and drive overnight to get home. I have still never received a refund for this awful experience. I cannot speak to other routes, but I would not recommend the Amtrak Coast Startlight to anyone for any reason, and will never use Amtrak again."
80,yelp.com,"How does a train that has no traffic run a half hour late?That, coupled with the Lake Shore Limited removing business class, reflects my review.  I did get my own seat up until Worcester, and sitting with someone else wasn't a problem, but I liked the business class room, and that, on top of how late the train ran (one would think that there were times there for a reason) reflect my drop off in review.  For the time I needed it, Amtrak worked out.  However, I'd have to consider the bus in the future, as at least in that case I have a better sense of when I'll arrive."
81,yelp.com,"Amtrak!I just took the train to get back to the wonderful world of Western Massland (it's a magical place beyond the barrier of 128, where the game of basket-ball was born).  In terms of simply this one route, a few things immediately spring to mind:1. I didn't have to wait in traffic.2. For just higher than the price I paid to get the privilege of being on a cramped coach bus, I was able to get a ticket upgrade to Business Class (it's Business Class!).3. AC plugs!  There's no wireless, but if you prepare right (and by prepare right, that means bring DVDs), you can get through the trip fine.I don't know what the Coach ride is like, but I did appreciate my business class ride."

94,yelp.com,"We recently took our second long distance ""USA Rail Pass"" journey. Beginning in Albany New York where we traveled on the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago then onto the Empire Builder which eventually took us to Seattle WA, although we stopped at a few places along the way in Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. We booked sleeping cars on most of the segments, which means you got all your meals included and because on the way back we stayed on the train throughout our trip, (Seattle to Chicago and Chicago back to Albany NY.) you pay only one fee for your accommodations. Keep in mind you're on a train, and sleeping in relatively small quarters is not for everyone, but it works. 95% of the employees are great!!! Food was pretty good! My only issue is apparently on some routes, including the Lake Shore Limited, they're trying something new. Meals are pre-packaged, and the menu is limited, but it was surprisingly good! Definitely better than airline food. The scenic views from the train are fantastic and you end up socializing a bit. You can't beat it! I know the equipment is old but very clean and updated. What most people don't like about train travel are the delays, which has nothing to do with Amtrak. They can't help it. ---Other than The Northeast Corridor and Keystone Corridor. both of which Amtrak owns, ---the rails are owned by Freight Railroads, which put their trains first, for the most part. All in all, we loved it. Hopefully, in the near future, Amtrak will get the funding it needs."
95,yelp.com,"Review of Amtrak NorthEaster train from BOS to NYC.By far, the best way to go from BOS to NYC.  Sure buses are cheaper, but Amtrak offers more room, open cars, dining options, very comfortable seating, work table/tray, and more.  Do yourself the favor, and go by train.Con's to the trip are few but include multiple stops at stations along the way, but that's really about it.  Some of the cars may not be plush or have tables for group work space, but they're decent none the less."

98,yelp.com,"I love trains (Sheldon and I would get along very well I think!). Now, I'm not talking about Metro... No no, I don't care about those. I'm talking about the regional ones that travel interstate.We took the Acela Express from Boston to NYC and the ride was so cool. I like how they have a compartment near the door for you to store your luggage. There's free Wi-Fi, which is always a winner. It's also very spacious between seats so you really feel comfy in your seats. The train was really clean and the bar at the back is great if you want to grab a drink or some food. Our train was on time and the ride was pretty quick although I wouldn't have cared if it took a bit longer though because the view was very nice. I'm definitely doing that again on my next visit and I might even do a night trip."
99,yelp.com,"Going from Boston to NYC was a little longer than I expected, about an hour delay total to reach Penn Station from South Station.  The train departed on time but we had several delays along the way, likely because of the snowfall.  The door got stuck on part of the trip so it was rather cold in the car I was ridding in plus it was packed so there was no room to sit elsewhere.  The ticket taker, seemed to have a bit of a problem when I asked how many more stops before Penn station (the speaker in the cabin was broken) so I had to ask the guy to repeat himself which he clearly did not like.  Next trip, I will likely pay for the 'upgrade' and see if I can have a bit of a better experience as there will be a need to do the Boston to NYC trip again before heading back to Atlanta.  Flying is too much of a hassle (cab(s), security, delays, etc...) for such a short trip so I am really hoping to make the best of a train ride."
100,yelp.com,"I have just had the worst customer service experience of my entire life. I purchased a ticket for a friend and it was attached to mine. The next day I needed to cancel my friends ticket and keep mine. I purchased insurance for the tickets and this insurance was purchased through the Amtrak website in the Amtrak checkout. I did this knowing I may need to cancel my friends ticket and felt better knowing I was covered and took the appropriate action. I called to cancel the ticket and was told that there would be a cancellation fee. I said I purchased insurance and that fee shouldn't apply. That is when I was told the insurance what outsourced. I said that was not made clear and I just wanted my ticket refunded. She said she couldn't help me and transferred me. I then spoke to a man that said no I would be reinbursed fully and he would facilitate the whole process, and then he promptly hung up on me and I ended up with another person and I had no idea who it was and they had no idea what was going on. I had to re-explain the whole story and was told they were insurance, and would not refund me, and that my insurance was not one that covered cancellation for miscellaneous. I then called Amtrak back, rexplained the whole thing and asked for a manager. I was told okay and transferred again. I again was with ANOTHER agent that I had to re-explain AGAIN the whole story and was told I could not speak to a manager and could not be refunded. May I also say the entire time all of this happened, every single agent was rude, aggressive, and condescending. At this point I was so frustrated and upset that I was crying. I told her that I had been put through the ringer, misinformed multiple times, the purchasing of the insurance and it's nuanced policies and outsourced nature was not made clear when I PURCHASED IT THROUGH AMTRAK. I said that I just wanted the 20 dollar cancel fee waved due to the lack of clarity in insurance policy and the horrible customer service. She transferred me to customer service. There I AGAIN explained it all, listened to the same cycle of rude, condescending banter. I made it clear what I wanted and why I felt it was warranted to have my fee waved.  The customer service agent then said ""I won't refund you because someone was rude"" in a mocking tone which tells me that she missed everything I told her about what I've been through or how I felt, and I felt it was an extremely inappropriate response for a customer service agent to provide. At this point I had spoken to 6 people, spent an hour, and needed to leave to go to my grandfathers funeral  and I freaked out and hung up. I am at a loss right now. This totally sent me over the edge and it was jarring to go through 6 people that could have helped me, yet refused to- OVER 20 DOLLARS ON THEIR END. Ultimately, this process cost me 40 dollars- 20 dollar cancellation fee and the 18 dollars I spend on insurance that wasn't even effective for what I wanted. I tried to do the right thing- I paid extra for insurance, I spoke to multiple agents and the insurance company, I made it clear exactly what I was seeking and why, and was met with derision, insult, and poor service. This is all over a train ticket. I wanted the 20 dollars back for my train ticket cancel fee, but apparently failure on the companies part to fully inform and serve customers is irrelevant. I hope you guys enjoyed that hour of my life,  my 40 dollars, and listening to me cry. Thanks."

However, coming back from NYC or PVD is an entirely different story.They might be delayed by 100% of the time it takes you to get to your destination. Meaning, I've had to wait for close to an hour in Providence for the train to get there. I love what they have done with the application!

113,yelp.com,"When heading to NY, you really can't beat the Acela Express.  True, it costs about the same as a flight, and takes a bit longer (but not much, when considering getting to and from the airport), but it drops you right in midtown at Penn Station, has comfortable seats, WiFi, and power outlets. Sure, you can't stream much video or music, but you generally can't do this on shared WiFi anyway.  Also?  There is a bar.  And a quiet car, if being next to people making noise makes you stabby.  Upgrade to first class, and get a free ""meal,"" but also free booze along the way."
114,yelp.com,"Amtrak Acela service from New York Penn Station to Boston is an expensive, but generally acceptable, trade-off.  When all factors of airline travel are considered, a flight has difficulty bettering the four hour Acela transit time.  While the endless miles of railroad siding and forest don't qualify as quality ""scenery,"" they better the view from ""the friendly skies"" by a wide margin.Acela seating is comfortable, with both foldout desktop and electrical power outlets supporting productive work.  The train seems to stop in every village and hamlet along the way, but they are better than the airlines at acknowledging that an actual on-time schedule exists.  I've traveled to several of the Boston Area train stations, and each time was only a quick cab ride to/from where I needed to be.  Compared to the airport experience, Amtrak wins.The Acela trains have ""quiet cars,"" and the majority of their inhabitants seem to grasp the concept.  There are also dining cars, where you can be gouged for substandard food, if you wish.  In particular, the microwaved hot dogs are beyond rubbery.  As with contemporary airline travel, you'll probably want to pack a sandwich."
115,yelp.com,"::This review is specifically for the Acela::Recently, I took the Acela train from Boston to New York City--and let me just say that as much as I love to fly, I would much rather take this train.With a super smooth ride, business class seating, and friendly service I cannot complain about the travel. With a first class feel and making convenient stops, you can't really beat the Acela. Sure it's more expensive, but consider this. In NYC, they drop you off/pick you up in Manhattan--no need for $40 cab rides to and from the airport. In Boston, it stops at Back Bay before ending at South Station--red line or orange line--you choose!Train over plane seems blasphemous, but it's true when traveling to Manhattan. If money is your concern, then just take a ride on the Fung Wah or Lucky Star. Airports really aren't worth the hassle for travel between Boston & NYC."
116,yelp.com,"Wow, the Acela has really improved since it first started operating.  I rode it from Boston to NY Penn on a beautiful sunny clear afternoon last week.  Got a regular ticket (not first class) for only $115, and I can't imagine any way the first class could have been any more comfortable than my seat was.  I always ride in the first car because it's the least full.  I always try to sit on the coast side when traveling southbound and inland side traveling northbound (that goes for the entire Northeast Corridor).  My favorite thing about Acela now is the very detailed trip-tracker map you can follow on your laptop or tablet.  Wifi included and two plugs for charging.   I applaud Amtrak for making improvements to this train ... it's really a pleasure to ride now."
117,yelp.com,"Going from Boston to New York, this really is the luxury way to travel.Sure, you could take a Chinatown bus for dirt cheap, but it might catch on fire and there's always the non-trivial probability of sitting next to a smelly crack dealer.And a flight is faster on paper, and often cheaper, but once you factor in the lines, the stress of airports, the groping TSA squad... how much is your sanity worth?I've even taken the overnight to the midwest for the holidays.  Cheaper than flying (ESPECIALLY during peak travel season), rather a bit longer, but MAN was it less stressful.  I just leaned back, plugged in my computer, chatted with the other passengers, and took naps.  It was quite pleasant.Of course, Amtrak has its difficulties.  It's horridly under-funded and has to share rails with freight.  But I blame that more on Republicans who'd rather subsidize a for-profit oil company than a public-service train company."

119,yelp.com,"This review will be both for the Acela Express First Class; since I am not sure where to yelp this. As a release I have actually never taken Amtrak Business Class or Standard Seat non Acela train.Environment:I have mixed feeling about the First Class on Acela when compared to flying. The main reason is because the train tends to vibrate and the your plate and utensils while slide back on the tray. The vibration gets really really annoying especially when trying to enjoy a wine and your glass is moving across the table. The train is very quite though and QC15 clear any remaining ambiance. The seats are very comfortable and wide. They are upholstered in blue leather and have good recline. The leather is in good condition and the windows are large. AC adapters are present which is excellent. On a plus side the First Class car was pretty much empty. The over heads also have ample room to fit a Tumi Alpha Continental Carry On or even larger. It does not seem as if Amtrak is policing the hand luggage policy. The bathroom is large and well lit, but really needs to be inspected and cleaned more often. Not to be picky but the first class bathroom shouldn't have used towels on the counters and the trash overflowing.*Also not a problem on my ride since the carriage was pretty much empty, but the original seat I decided to sit in had coffee spill marks and crumbs all over the carpet. Amtrak should take a bit more time tidying the train after each run. This could have caused some issues if the train was full.Food:The food was good and very similiar when compared to United's trans con flights in United First. The best part was getting a proper sized wine glass not one of dinky tiny sample glass when you fly. I was pretty full so order some light cheese and crackers. The crackers were packaged and the cheese was served at an appropriate temperature and had a good texture and color. As mentioned the tray tends to run across the table because of the trains vibration. A possible solution could be using a dinning table cloth as the airlines provide. It was nice to receive proper metal utensils and quality dinning linen. Service:5 of 5 for service. The cabin attendant was excellent. She personally introduced herself to each passenger which was about 5 and took our orders. Routinely made rounds and refiled the wine. Amtrak is not stingy at all in this area. I think by the time ended I was clearly buzzed. Thank goodness I was taking a cab at my destination. The happy cheer personality and service attitude seemed truly genuine throughout the journeyOther:As a whole I was pretty happy, but for the price paid I might consider Acela Business Class on my next trip."
120,yelp.com,"I love Amtrak! It's the most comfortable way to travel. I've taken the Acela and the Northeast Regional coach seats numerous times,  as well as the Vermonter (8 hours, NY to VT, both coach and business class) twice.The Amtrak ride is pretty smooth, with little traffic, and the trains don't have that stinky bus smell like, well, a bus. Plus, a good portion of the NY-Boston trip is next to the water, so you get a pretty view, too. The Vermonter travels mostly through the woods, which is also pretty to look at, until it gets dark out. Then the impressive darkness is only punctuated by a few cute towns and the light from houses.My favorite part about taking Amtrak is the AC plugs. I can plug in my laptop and watch movies. It's not 4 hours to NY...it's 4 episodes of ""Grey's Anatomy.""  The seats are roomy and comfortable, although in coach you can start feeling stiff after a few hours, though if the train's not crowded they let you lie down on two seats. Plus, the staff is always nice and the bathrooms are as clean as a moving bathroom will get. You can get snacks at the Cafe Car, but they are really expensive so I don't bother.  Their luggage policy is reasonably lenient, so you can bring a 2 suitcases plus a backpack and a laptop case. And if that second suitcase happens to be the laundry bag from your dorm room, Amtrak doesn't usually mind.The Acela train is definitely nicer than the regular cars they use, but it's not always worth the extra money. Beware of high-volume days when they rotate in the old coaches with the red seats-they're less comfortable and don't always have AC plugs. Also beware of the Quiet Car if you plan on making any noise whatsoever, since it's supposed to be ""library quiet"" and some passengers interpret that as ""morgue quiet.""  The Quiet Car varies from train to train (it's usually an end car though) so pay attention when the conductor announces where it is.Amtrak customer service is usually good about making ticket adjustments if you need to cancel or change your trip. All in all, the best way to travel."
121,yelp.com,"I'd never traveled Amtrak before, but this past September I needed to go one-way to Albany to meet my dad, and the $21 price was right, so I decided to try it. Bad idea!The problem wasn't just that my 11:30 train from Back Bay turned into a 6:30 bus from South Station (which it did).  Or that I had to stay in South Station all afternoon, when I was missing half a day of work for the trip at my office 5 minutes from the station (which I did). Because they wouldn't let us leave the station, even briefly, despite having no clear idea of what the problem was or how they would fix it, ever (which they didn't). Or that the maximum they can give you for your trouble is the price of your ticket (which it is).The main problem was how profoundly unconcerned the Amtrak personnel were with the plight of the 100+ passengers who spent 6+hours sitting groaning on the floor of the station (some with small crying children, some crying themselves). Even small airlines will usually give delayed passengers *something*: meal voucher, useless coupon, whatever. Amtrak didn't even give us updates unless we banded together, cornered someone, and acted belligerent.I still have my voucher they gave me for my next trip. Hmmm, the shredder at my office is looking hungry..."
122,yelp.com,"When traveling to the great place called New York City, I take the Amtrak.  Why?  Because I refuse to drive all that way on the pike and 84 and tappan zee and GW -- you get the picture, riiight?  I leave from South Station early in the morning.  Usually around 7:45am and the train is almost deserted.  I eat my breakfast and drink my tea while listening to my IPOD and reading the Globe.  I enjoy pleasant conversation with my traveling companion.  Sometimes, I am just really quiet and look out the window.  And, before I know it, I'm in Manhattan!Easy!"

134,yelp.com,"I love the Acela. Traveling between New York and Boston on a monthly or bimonthly basis, I've pretty much exhausted the options for inter-city transportation. Unfortunately, it seems that everything from the Fung-Wah to first class has it's drawbacks. On the low end, many of the bus lines are crowded, cramped, and on the slow side. On the high end you have flying which is much quicker but very expensive, which along with the hassle of TSA and the New York airports makes it hard to stand.Right in the middle you have the Amtrak/Acela lines. They are cheap-ish and offer a nice ride to and from Boston with one major advantage over all other methods of transportation: the ability to move around. I don't care what you take, everything will be delayed at one point or another. When that happens, I want to be able to walk around and stretch my legs from time to time. Since I'm 6'3"" being able to do this is a huge plus for me. Additionally the leg room is unparalleled.The one downside is that it's more than double the price of the next cheapest option. To this I say that I would rather drink 2-3 fewer drinks at a bar and ride up comfortably than be crammed on a bus and arrive tired and pissed off."
135,yelp.com,"I went to Virginia this summer to pick up my niece for a visit. Amtrak does not possess long distance fast trains like other industrialized areas of the world. They were surprised to hear that anyone could cover that distance in less than 13 hours. As a point of reference, the approximate 600 miles between Boston and Virginia takes 13 hours, or about 46 mph. The approximate 550 miles between Paris and Berlin takes 8 hours, or about 68 mph. A similar distance in Japan is as fast as the European trek. Spent a cold, uncomfortable night (in August... the A/C was blasting) without a footrest, which would have made all the difference in the world, woke up to decent coffee, but a horrible breakfast otherwise: full of high fructose corn syrup... who the heck needs that for yogurt and granola? But that was the best thing they offered, so that gives you an idea. The trains are not quiet at all and they made no effort to keep a noisy car and a quiet car, so your standard group of boorish jerks sat at one end of my car shouting at each other for several hours in what they apparently considered witty and erudite conversation between about midnight and 3am. The platforms at Back Bay Station are so poorly marked that I actually boarded a commuter train before realizing my mistake (and really, that of the conductor who looked at my Amtrak tickets and told me to get on the train). We had a forty minute stop in DC that they did not announce or explain. Some people apparently knew enough to get up, get off the train and get some semi-real food. I wish I had. The ride back with a 10 year old was a little bit better because at least I knew what to expect, so we had a blanket with us. I still needed a footrest. Seriously, a little pulldown bar would have really and truly made a huge difference. I felt bad for the group of college students who had no idea about the A/C who then spent time trying to make spare t-shirts into blankets. It's cheaper to take the train than to fly or drive. It's not as cheap as it is in other countries with faster trains, oddly enough. If I'd slept in my car I could've made it possibly cheaper to drive, but ... did I really want to spend 4 days driving up and down the eastern seaboard, 2 of those with a 10 year old? I thought about it, and decided the slowest train in the industrialized world was probably the best option. On the way back I refused to get off at Back Bay and went right into South Station, where I had to go anyway for the commuter rail back out to Worcester. It doesn't really matter which one you board/disembark at, apparently, so I would recommend South Station any day over the other."

137,yelp.com,"I've been traveling on the Acela weekly for work now for about three months.  I am a HUGE fan of the train.My Comfort:+  I am 6'3"" and not particularly skinny.  I always have plenty of leg room and general comfort in the seats.+  The tray for the seats is also large enough to work comfortably.+  There are frequently tables available if I need one.+  The Quiet Car is awesome when I don't want distractions.+  The other cars are great if I'm going to be talking on the phone or just want background chatter.+  The cafe car is reasonably priced and much of the food is good.  Coffee, beer, fruit, hummus, yogurt, etc - all good.  The pizza and anything else that has to be microwaved is as a good as any frozen microwave food.My Time Spent:+ I can arrive at the station 6 minutes before the train leaves, buy a ticket and be on the platform before the train arrives.  Tell me again when you fly how soon before you actually take off that you arrive?+ My entire trip is enjoyable and productive time spent - for the entire time on the train.  When I think of taxi, check-in, security, gate, delay, boarding, take-off, flight, touch-down, exit, taxi - I can get about 20 minutes of decent time door to door for that entire experience.  When you consider delays it's often not even longer to take the train.-  They are doing some electrical work so it is standard to have a 10-20 minute delay.  But at least I'm in a comfortable seat working.The Experience:+  Oh my the fellow travelers are polite and friendly.  Courteous.  Conversing with strangers.  Offering help.  Maybe the same people would be a grouch or jerk on the plane - you know, small seats, security lines, delays.+  The view between Boston and New York is sometimes achingly beautiful, from seaside boats to harbors to marshes.The Cost:-  Yes, it is expensive, but not much more than a flight with airport and taxis.  I am happy to pay to keep the Acela running."
138,yelp.com,"I had my first Amtrak experience on Friday and it was very good.  I wish I had taken it home too but I didn't.  I went to CT from Boston, and it was a quick and smooth ride (unlike buses, yack).  The guys on the train were wicked friendly.  There was adequate space above to put my bag as well as space to put my second bag underneath my seat.  I loved the outlets available to charge my phone, plenty of leg room and room for the person in front to lean back, that was cool.  My trip was a little over two-two and a half hours, but it flew by.  It made maybe four or five stops before mine and it was continuing on to DC.  I really enjoyed the trip.  I would have taken it back to Boston but the price is what deterred me from that, it was very expensive."
139,yelp.com,"I am losing faith in my favorite mode of transportation.  As I write this, the train is lumbering along at a healthy 15 to 20 miles per hourGood thing it's the Acela or I may be going backwardsMy last trip was delayed 2 hours as we sat in the train waiting for a locamotiveThese two incidents have allowed me sufficient time to ponder Amtraks main weakness: lack of communication to it's passengers about problems and lack of service recovery....Way back was way better...Changing tickets lacks the hassle of airlines and Conductor Bob was a tripFaith somewhat restored"

141,yelp.com,"Good stuff, not-so-good stuff about Amtrak...but mostly good stuff. Before 1997 my trips on Amtrak were far fewer but since my sister moved to NYC back then I've become a more frequent rider. I've taken other forms of transportation to Manhattan and points south but I'd recommend Amtrak over the rest.Good stuff? Ticketing and booking reservations is easy, as is changing a reservation. Employees at the stations and aboard the trains are friendly, knowledgable, and take pride in serving the public. That counts for a lot. Aboard the train there's room to use one's laptop, sleep without becoming too cramped, and a cafe car to get a snack, sandwich, or cocktail. When the train is moving the ride is relatively comfortable and passengers aren't tossed around. And the view...on the way down the Connecticut shoreline is so close you could touch it.That said, there are a few things that take away from what could be an almost perfect travelling experience. The on-time performance of Amtrak trains in the Northeast isn't great. I have dealt with delays of between 20 minutes and 2 hours a number of times in the past couple of years and I hope they'll cease. The train schedule is adequate but would be vastly improved by the addition of a couple of more trips, especially one that would leave Boston earlier on weekday mornings. Prices aren't exactly cheap, but can be justified by a ride superior to driving a car down Route 95 or taking the bus into NYC.A couple of tips...embarking at either Route 128 in Westwood or at Back Bay Station means you can avoid the South Station crowds. Granted, you may not get your choice of seats, but these stations are still convenient to Boston. Also, on your way to Boston...try to get aboard a train that originates at Washington, DC. Generally the trains that start south of there must travel on CSX tracks and that arrangement sometimes causes delays for the Amtrak trains."
142,yelp.com,"The Acela is by far the easiest most painless way to get to and from Manhattan. Hands down. Sure, it can be a little late getting out of Penn Station, but at least you are at Penn Station, not stressed out, stuck in a cab on your way to JFK where you will wait and wait and wait for your JetBlue plane to take off. Once you sit down, you can tune out, stretch out, chill out, and enjoy the ride. I've been more relaxed riding the train than most anywhere else in recent memory. A great time to read, do some work, or get loaded in the cafe car. Contrast this with the tragicomedy of flight attendants rushing to dole out beverages on the ascent  out of Boston only to collect your cup a few minutes later as the seatbelt sign illuminates and you prepare to queue up for a cab to get to your meeting in NYC.The scenery coming from Boston in the morning is, frankly, breathtaking, and passing by coastline feels civilized.  It's cheaper, easier, with no security thugs to inspect your dirty socks, and feels, gasp, continental. Imagine! Door to door I get to where I need to go in the same amount of time it would take via flying. No joke."
143,yelp.com,"Every mode of transportation between Boston and New York has its positives and negatives.  While I generally prefer flying into LGA on the Delta Shuttle, the Acela runs a close second in terms of how to get into the city.  The Acela leaves from South Station and Back Bay (since I live on the Orange Line I like to pick the train up there) and makes its journey to Route 128 and Providence before a few stops in CT and NY.  While the Acela is touted as a high speed train, it is hardly that (especially if you've ever traveled overseas and witnessed actual high speed train travel).  Once the train approaches Fairfield County in CT, it starts to share tracks with Metro North and subsequently never puts the ponies under the hood to the test.  It is a far more comfortable ride than the Regional, it saves you about 20 minutes, but it also costs a bit more.  The good news is that you don't need to fit your toiletries in three-ounce bottles, you don't have to take off your shoes at security, and you are free to walk around during the journey.  There is a cafe car with some food and beverages, though the food is a bit lackluster, so I usually pack my own provisions.  The quiet car is also a great feature, as it pretty much becomes the Bates Reading Room at the Copley Library.  The other cabins may mean you overhear some conference calls and sales pitches while you are on your journey.  You have ample leg room and you don't have to worry about someone getting annoyed when you recline your seat.  At the end of your trip from Boston, you are conveniently dumped out at Penn Station which is a great springboard for getting around the rest of the city."
144,yelp.com,"First experience with amtrak: pleasant, but other than the sale of beer and food car, not much different than a bolt bus.Until... the lines broke in New Haven. Delayed indefinitely. I had to spend the night there, and because they still hadn't fixed the problem the next morning, had to buy a bus ticket to NYC. fast forward to TWO MONTHS and well over six hours of time on hold trying to reach customer service reps:They finally call me. The rep can't find my reservation, so she requests my credit card number. I told her it would take a minute or two to bring it up, and she threatened to hang up on me. Yes, after well over six hours on hold for her, she is going to hang up on me after two minutes. Eventually, she told me the only thing she could get me were  two $100 vouchers.I am out over $500 for this entire experience. I now have two $100 vouchers that will expire in January.

156,yelp.com,My son (!4) and I rode the Acela to NY for a quick day trip. I was in Boston for business and he had come along.  I grew up in NYC and we had to take the opportunity to go to NYC even for just 6 hours. We are also big train fans (we once rode the California Zephyr from San Francisco to Denver) so taking the Acela was a must even if all we did was turn around and come back. We were staying in the back Bay and could have gotten on there but we wanted to start from the beginning and make sure we got a good seat for the trip. When heading south to NY sit on the left side so you can see the shore when it's possible. The train itself is very cool looking and the interior has a business jet feel. Big comfy seats and lots of room and wifi and power at each row. I download an app for my iPhone that showed our speed. The stretch between Boston and Providence is the quickest. We hit 150 for a bit. In a plane you have no concept for how fast thou are going at high altitude. But in this train going even 135 feels really fast. There are many business people and they talk on the on the phone (a lot!) so if you want quiet sit in the quiet car. Cafe car has standard Amtrak fare so if you want something better get it at the station. Bathrooms are nice and big. Our train to NY arrived 30 minutes late so my son and I really had to book it to Yankee Stadium so we didn't miss our tour. Our return train later that night (7PM) was also late arriving from DC but it managed to arrive at Boston Back Bay on time. I really didn't care that it was late as we were on an adventure together. It was all part of a really memorable trip my son and I will cherish for many years.
157,yelp.com,"Bad customer service - STILL, after all these years.But - if you need to get back home to Connecticut from Boston (after flying into Logan like I did) -  it's a lot better than Greyhound, and is one of your only options.The trains out of Boston are ALWAYS crowded, so grab a seat fast - as it's first come first served.TIP: leave out of South Station (if you can), as opposed to Back Bay - as you'll get first dibs on the seats that way.The Acela is way overpriced - don't bother. Go with the local runs - as the service is just as lousy (either way), and you'll get to your destination not all that much faster, anyways."

I'll take it.My first experience with Amtrak was in California, not different than my more recent experience in Boston/NY.  The only difference is traveling with the big wigs from work versus by myself. If traveling from NY to Boston, or vice versa, take the Acela. Otherwise, this trip could feel like eternity! Upgrade to first class, splurge - it's worth it."

There's nothin g that resembles fresh, not even a rotten apple on the shelf.   Otherwise, Amtrak offers classic and post modern junk and booze to take the edge off the price of your comfortable seats and relaxing views."
160,yelp.com,"Just finished a trip from Boston south station with a connection in Chicago to San Francisco. If I had to do it again, I would fly to Chicago and do the 2 nights to California from there. Let me first say the sleeper on the Boston to Chicago leg was actually a few inches bigger than the Chicago train. That being said there were a couple of things that were terrible about the Boston leg....1- the sleeper car was RIGHT BEHIND the locomotive car! Not so good. They literally blew the horn every few minutes ALL NIGHT LONG. 2- there was no proper mining car on the Boston leg. Which meant all meals were literally microwaved. Yeah. Which had this been a camp ground or a hostile I wouldn't care. But for what we paid.... Onto the good. And there was a lot good, cool, fascinating about it. Our car attendants (both legs) were excellent! Turn down service, answer questions, explaining things about trains etc. sense of humor. We asked for extra pillows and viola! Pillows. I would suggest that if you like air flow; bring a personal fan. There is outlets in each room. They cannot possibly please everybody on the car with temps. And both my husband and I run HOT. We have a fan going all winter (and we live in NE). The first leg each room had a toilet. Which was great for my 2x pee in the middle of the night. The views were pretty cool. People were rather friendly. The observation lounge was nice. There was a cafe underneath it for light snacks & beverages of all types. It was rather relaxing. Meals were pretty good for a train. They were cooked to order. Dinners are done by reservations. Or you could have your room attendant bring dinner to your room. We did that 50% of the time. Plan on always being seated with other travelers. If there are 2 in your party you will be seated with another party of 2. If there are 3 they will stick a single person with you etc. they have limited seating. It is what it is. I'm very outgoing and it wasn't my favorite part. However, we did meet some fascinating people. Which gave us some interesting conversations. My husband is much more shy then me; so we opted for 50% of meals in dinner car. Dessert comes with every meal. Except breakfast. Each car attendant brews fresh coffee each morning for their car. Which was great! Bathrooms were kept shockingLY clean for a train. All in all, great experience. Would highly recommend."

177,yelp.com,"This was my first experience taking the Acela Express from Boston to NYC. I've had no problems with the shuttles from Logan, but this time I needed to end up right in Times Square so I figured it was worth a shot. All seats are ""business class"", but I think once everyone becomes ""special"" it's pretty clear that nobody is. The seats are fairly spacious and comfy, but I'm not sure what is ""business class"" about them. I guess they aren't the plastic benches on the T buses. There is also constant minor turbulence from the track, but really this should be expected. Finally, aside from cruising pretty fast from Boston to Providence this train has not been very ""express"", particularly on some really slow stretches through CT. The food is atrocious. I was starving so I settled on a chef salad and the ONLY salad dressing option was ""Buttermilk Farms"" which essentially was mayo mixed with more oil. Disgusting. It's nice to have internet the whole time, but that connection is spotty at best. It took about 5 minutes to load yelp and login, but there isn't really anything else to do. Overall it's not a terrible experience, but I think I'll stick with the airport shuttles and deal with potential delays and TSA nonsense."

Trains have electric outlets for you laptops.  Each train has a quiet car and a snack car, so you can get some hot tea or a bagel.  You can reserve a table and have a real meal, or some variation of it.   I would give them five stars if they would post the track # a little earlier then 10 min to departure.  Its quite chaotic.  Once they post it, and god forbid you are standing in the wrong place, the crowd will mow you down and noone would even blink an eye.  So, location, location, location, eyes on the table, and once you see the track number posted, run for your life."
179,yelp.com,"First time riding a train and it went well.Arrived at Boston South Station and was issued a ticket from the ticketing agent. The station is nice with an abundant food court and monitors everywhere. Almost missed my train because I was too busy yapping on the phone to a friend about people lining up on the tracks. After hanging up and checking the monitors, realized, hey! those people are taking the same train as me and it's about to leave! Made it onboard with less than a minute to spare.Coach seating is ample big. Much better than flying. Free wifi and AC plugins on the Acela Express.What was really nice was that when we approached my stop, the conductor stopped by my seat and reminded me that the next stop would be where I was getting off. Fantastic service!"
180,yelp.com,"Sure, I would LOVE to review Amtrak in lieu of finishing my thesis.Yes, it is more expensive than flying. Usually a round-trip ticket for me from Boston to Philly is $150ish; Acela is obviously another $80 or so. But, if you consider the amount of money spent getting to and from the airport--especially given the Silver Line's shiteous history of shitosity--it evens the gap a bit.Also consider not having to go through security, removing your shoes on the one day you wore mismatched, holey socks, taking off all your jewelry, forgetting your belt buckle, having to go back through security, alarm goes off again, TSA employee motions you to the side and starts wand-ing you, something in your chestal region goes off, she starts patting you down on the one day you've only worn an old, sweaty undershirt, and after all that, you discover that the underwire in your bra is poking out and that's what's making the alarm go off, but first, you had to suffer a major loss of time and embarrassment because everyone boarding the same JetBlue flight as you knows that you have a gigantic toe-hole in your sock-piece.Plus South Station has an Au Bon Pain.I've only ever been delayed 20 minutes on the train. Perhaps I've been lucky, but I rarely hear horror stories.The trains are comfortable, I love the quiet car, and the humming of the tracks and the wind is quite calming. I like."
181,yelp.com,"I am currently resting my ass on a horizontally friendly leather seat, stopping myself from laughing at my neighbor as she googles - I shit you not - the phrase ""hemorrhoid cream side effects."" THANK THE SWEET LORD FOR WIFI ON ACELA! It's about time you listened, Amtrak.Let me backtrack: I have been travelling to New York almost every weekend on business. I prefer the car as I can get door-to-door in 3 hours for the price of an Indian lunch buffet, but since my car was murdered by an enormous pine tree a few weeks ago, I have had to resort to public transportation.Being a cheap college senior in a recession, I generally opt for the $15 Bolt bus which features electrical outlets and wifi, but the speed, accessibility, and comfort of Amtrak, particularly its Acela line, are too great to overlook. For half the price of a plane ticket, I can sit back, relax, and occasionally get some work done.Amtrak has made some improvements in the past few months, too. For one, they have decreased  their one-way ticket prices by about 25% (from about $93 to $79 depending on how early you book). Secondly, they have a generous Amtrak Rewards program for frequent travelers (e.g. I received a free round-trip ticket from Boston to New York after only three trips). Finally, and most importantly, they have armed their travelers with WIFI access, giving them the tools to cure hemorrhoids one Google search at a time.Thank you, Amtrak. You are so worth the money now."
182,yelp.com,"""We'll have to wait until the power comes on, but it won't be more than a minute after that.""  I was in the café car heading from Boston to NYC this morning, and had just ordered up a sausage, egg, and cheese for breakfast.  It's been a long time since I took the train and I forgot how Euro it makes me feel.  The ding of the microwave cut my dreams of northern Italy short and the friendly cashier handed over the perfectly wrapped Jimmy Dean breakfast Sammy.  ""It's hot"" she said.  My brother was with me too, and ordered the same thing.  Plenty of booths were open in the car, so we set up shop somewhere near Kingston, R.I. and took in the sites of the coast, the sounds of the train, and the pungent smells of the sausage.  My god it smelled outrageous.Crossing into Connecticut, the sun was strong and illuminated the contents of my now unwrapped breakfast.  Inside, a disturbingly well proportioned biscuit, egg, sausage patty, and cheese slice sat in all its glory.  Piping hot and oh so fragrant the temptation was overwhelming.  I dove in.  Soft but firm, like a Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpet with more salt.  Yes I was starving, and my strike zone was huge, but I can say without hesitation that this particular sandwich was absolutely delicious.This sandwich was constructed in Illinois, or so it said on the wrapper.  How they crafted 4 individual ingredients to be the exact same circumference, to the mm, I'll never know.  About the same width as a tennis ball, I am certain I could slide four, maybe five if I press, of the sandwiches into an empty tennis ball can.  Half way through, I was impressed with how well everything stayed together, no mess, a perfect snack for a train.  At just under $5, I couldn't have asked for more.  Had I not been fighting motion sickness from traveling backwards and smelling sausage this entire time, I would have ordered up another.In short, I can recommend the SEC Sammy on the Amtrak train."
183,yelp.com,"Tickets for the 6:45 pm train on Friday night to NYC.Train doesn't actually arrive until 7:45.No one tells us why.Show a little empathy when dealing with people who are attempting to reach a destination by a certain time...and they are confused, stressed, and feeling like you don't give an effin' damn because you decide that you have better things to do while sitting on your ass behind the counter...and basically tell them that. Ugh. Waste of money."
184,yelp.com,"I've taken both the Acela and regional trains to NYC...and there has been only one time that I have actually arrived on time, without delay. It's a frustrating experience to be caught on a train...it's much like traffic except I don't have a horn to honk angrily while shaking my fist at the gods. This last time, I purchased two tickets from Boston to NYC on the regional 6:45 pm train on a Friday night. Things were looking great! I printed my tickets at the kiosk, the train arrived right on time, we found good seats a couple cars away from the snack car and the first hour of travel was smooth. And then came New London...A mile outside the New London stop, with people standing in the aisles, lining up to jump of the train...we screech to halt. 20 minutes later...we're still not moving. But why? We don't know. 40 minutes later a tinny voice comes on and inaudibly describes something over the loudspeaker and then the power shuts off. The car becomes incredibly hot and uncomfortable. While the electricity is off the voice comes back and says - oh hi...we have a disabled train in front of us that is on a dead track and can't get powered back up. We are basically trying to juice up and jumpstart that train to get things moving again. At this point, it was time to start drinking. Thank God that Amtrak not only serves beer and wine, but they serve hard liquor as well. A glass of wine and a gin and tonic later...the hour and a half that we spent sitting on the train didn't seem so bad. Except that I was sweltering hot and desperately wanted to strip to my skiivies.We arrived not at 10:45pm as expected, but at 12:15am. Not the best experience on Amtrak I've had...Bolt Bus is climbing the food chain."
185,yelp.com,"Amtrak offers two trains out of South Station: Regional Service (to/from Washington via New York and the once a day train to/from Chicago) and the Acela (also known as the ""fancy"" train).The duration of each trip is about the same (3.5 hours for the Acela, and 4-4.5 on the Regional), but the service is worlds-apart.I've been fortunate enough to take the Acela First Class (the rest of the train is Business Class), which included the following highlights:- Access to the Acela Lounge, a nice pre-waiting area with snacks and beverages away from the hordes of other passengers (essentially, Amtrak's answer to the Admiral's Club)- Priority Boarding- Deluxe leather seating, either in 1 or 2 seat configurations (I secured a single seat row)- Gourmet meal (I had a salmon lunch with risotto)- Open barService was exquisite and it was a nice way to travel to New York for my birthday.  They were quite generous with the drinks, too, and I felt no pain very quickly.  There's no shame in drinking at 11 AM!My experiences on Acela Business Class and the Regional have both been extremely positive.  My favorite part of train travel is avoiding security lines and wait times at the airport, the fact that I can use my computer (the Acela now has Wi-Fi), and the total trip time is still less if you consider everything it takes to board a plane.  Plus, there are usually no delays due to weather (except under extreme conditions).While the bus is the cheapest way to go, and flights might be less ""travel"" time, trains are a beautiful way to experience the trip.For a good discount on trains, check out the National Association of Railroad Passengers (NARP) for an ongoing 10% discount on the Regional and that discount on Acela (which almost NEVER has discounts) on weekends only.  It's $35 a year and you'll make it back in 2-3 trips.The biggest tip I can impart is book early!  Oh, and join Guest Rewards to earn free travel.  If you really travel a lot, also get the Chase card."

When I eventually got through to an agent I told her I was trying to locate my reservation number because I may have accidentally deleted the email containing the reservation number.  She said ""you had better look for it because our systems are down and I won't be able to find your details by name, email or telephone number"" and with that she hung up!! There was no ""service"" in customer service. It was so bad, I thought she was joking! Cannot understand why Amtrak would employ these types of people to interface with the public on their behalf."

The staff was incredibly rude. I was with one other person, we were trying to buy some water. They charge 3 dollars for a normal sized bottle by the way, so bring your own if you can. I was not speaking to the woman who was ringing us up for the water, but to the person I was with, asking if she thought there might be a bathroom on the floor we were on. The woman ringing us up gave me the most dirty look, and said “this is a train, it’s not that hard to understand where the bathrooms are.” Overall one of the worst travel experiences of my life, and I’d recommend you keep your money and find an alternate experience as I will not be traveling with them again if I can avoid it."

196,trustpilot.com,"We bought ferry tickets from Seattle, WA to Victoria, BC at the start of July. We turned up to the ferry terminal with our tickets at the end of July, only to be told that our tickets were not valid, Amtrak sell duplicate/invalid tickets so there was no seat for us. We ended up stranded in Seattle. We ended up getting a 3hr bus journey with Greyhound to Port Angeles, WA and then a 3hr Black Ball ferry from Port Angeles to Victoria. We arrived in Victoria 10 hours later than we were meant to & we ended up missing out on visiting the Butchart Gardens as it had closed by the time we arrived in Victoria, so we also lost out on money for that too. Amtrak refunded the $253 cost of the fake tickets. However, refused any compensation for the inconvenience, time wasted, or the  visit to Butchart Gardens which we missed because of Amtrak selling us fake/invalid tickets. They offered a voucher for another Amtrak journey which is completely useless to us because firstly we’re from the UK & are unlikely to require train/bus/ferry transport in the USA anytime soon, but also suffice to say I will never use Amtrak again regardless of their coupon. I will also be telling anyone who asks to avoid this company at all costs because there was no way of knowing the tickets were invalid until we turned up for the time of the journey. Awful experience."
197,trustpilot.com,"We thought we would take the train to NYC, and get business class seats. LoL. What a joke. First, there is NO difference between business class and economy, other than the seat color. Second, you might have more freedom in economy. We were regulated to our assigned seats from the moment we entered, despite the car being empty. Our conductor was curt, somewhat rude and surly. No smile, no service. So business class on Amtrak is just an opportunity for Amtrak to earn more money. Maybe Amtrak should take lessons from world-class train services across the globe, to perhaps improve their service and their profitability. Next time, we will drive. It's cheaper and faster and we don't have to deal with disgruntled staff. ....Amtrak. Just an awful experience."
198,trustpilot.com,"I haven't taken Amtrak in years, with REASON. I returned to take an Acela train from Stamford, CT (a hub) to Washington, D.C. I arrived at the station 20 minutes early. I entered very near the track my train was to depart from and confirmed with some passersby that that I was indeed heading to the right place. I then trekked around the station to see if I could get an Amtrak employee with a computer to confirm. With an eye roll, I was told that the ""DC train ALWAYS leaves from track 4."" Well, it didn't that day and I couldn't hear the announcement of a track change over the jackhammering going on due to construction in the station. I ended up getting on the wrong train and disembarked in Providence, RI. While I love Providence, I didn't plan on arriving in DC via points north. So now an extra 4 hours of my life are being taken up by the incompetence of the very company I am paying to transport me. Never again. I'll fly, which is also horrible, but at least I will more likely be on the right plane."

I send an email and no response, I call and they can cancel my tickets and I can pay for a completely new set of tickets but at receiving a cancellation fee. I just think that’s crazy. I’d have been fine with repaying for new tickets but a few. That’s sad because I’m a consistent customer. Just unfortunate. I’m not mad just can’t believe companies have to get their money this way."
204,trustpilot.com,"My two last trips were both delayed by around one hour. The last one, from Philadelphia to Washington, was delayed by 54 min. I was instructed by Amtrak staff at the train station to report the delay to Amtrak customer relations to either be refunded the cost of the trip or obtain a credit towards future trips. After waiting on hold twice for around 30 min, I was told that a delay of 43 min (the train made up for some of the delay) is not considered significant enough. I find this unacceptable. Any railway system in Western Europe and Japan would consider delays longer than 15 minutes as significant. Both delays were caused by equipment breakdown. Such a high frequency of failure is a sign of poor maintenance and/or antiquated infrastructure. It is all lagging many years behind the modern railways in other developed countries."

Their phones are busy and so you are waiting for a text response from them. I waited about 15 - 20 minutes before getting a text that asked for the last 4 digits of the card used to purchase the tickets. This required me to go upstairs, grab my husbands wallet to get his debit card (the one used), and in the time it took for me to do that, the person, texted, ""I'm sorry, since I haven't heard from you, I will be closing this chat.""      So, I'm now waiting for ANOTHER text response. I think after reading some of the other reviews, and my personal experience, I don't think we will do business with Amtrak in the future.

And the food service was excellent. But there were some downsides. As you've gathered from previous reviews, Amtrak operates on tracks owned by freight companies, and they are often delayed by freight traffic, in spite of federal laws to the contrary. Our trip was running about 4 hours late. The really odd, and unfortunate thing: We had to leave the train in Reno because there were not enough operating toilets. Amtrak bused us to Sacramento, and then we rode the Capitol Corridor to Emeryville. Running late was understandable, but still a big disappointment because we passed through some of the best scenery after dark. But the inoperable toilets is really hard to accept. Still, on balance it was a great trip."

Today, it is almost 10 hours late,  a series of issues apparently. We have to drive an hour to pick up family from the station. It was supposed to be in around 8:30 last night. It just arrived minutes before 6:00am this morning, now my husband (who is picking them up) is late for work.

I am hoping to include photos too at the end. The table had visible spill marks the walls had sticky dirty marks and the curtain was unsanitary. The communal toilets needed more cleaning attention too. Scenery was spectacular, food was good and the dining car staff were lovely. On one occasion I had to let the conductor know that the outside door in the sleeping quarters was left open, as we were travelling along. The second night was incredibly bumpy with lots of horn blowing. Be aware."

The second rep, although she resolved my issue, had just as horrible of an attitude and also ended the call abruptly... NEWS FLASH: Without patrons, you'd BOTH be unemployed. Hopefully these were two isolated incidents because I can't imagine paying customers actually put up with this condescending treatment."
229,trustpilot.com,"Let’s see…where to begin. Our ride out from Penn to Rochester.  We were 2 hours late into Rochester.  The cafe car had 6 or 7 tables. However, three were filled with employees who were very vocal with profanities about their employment. Another table was filled with files and paper work of another Amtrak employee.  Leaving two available tables for paying ticket holders.Return trip…Rochester to Penn.Fowl mannered cafe employee that was kirt, rude and short with me and a young lady in front of me.  Confirmed by my husband who also watched the same tone and manor to someone in front of him.Currently we are stuck at Utica station without electrical power.  And have been for 20 minutes which of course means we will not be on time into Penn station.Honestly this is so very sad!  I lived in Europe for years and never in all my train travels did any one of the issues occurred.It boggles the mind that Amtrak can not get their act together and provide an efficient and pleasant experience.Maybe the big bosses of Amtrak should head over to Europe and sit in on some meetings to see why things work so well, have pleasant even nice employees,  run on efficient time schedules, are cost affordable and overall just better at their train services. On a scale of 1 to 10. One being the best 10 the worst.  Amtrak falls at a 3 to me.And the only reason a 3 is because of the convenience of not driving."

Don't get me wron I have had  a few good ones. I also had some with bad attitudes. Most of all my experiences with Amtrak has been wonderful. My meals were very satisfying and delicious.  I was on the Coastal Starlight 02/27/23From Portland Oregon to Los Angeles CA. Please give Maggie 5 stars 🌟 for an excellent job well-done Bonnie King."

Received a robo call at 4:00am saying there was a delay.  Website said still on time.  Called at 6:00am and was told train delayed until 1:30pm.  No updates and when we got to the station we were told train was arriving at 4:30pm.  No help from staff, website.  Went to airport and rented a car.  Train route is supposed to be very scenic but be aware.  No communication."

233,trustpilot.com,"Eh. Fancy new app which refreshes constantly and for what? The arrival time remains but unless the engine has us going faster than light we will be about 30 minutes late. Maybe it has better than light speed: it takes us around the earth backwards like Superman did until we’ve gone back in time 38 minutes Or the Star Trek thing where the train will fly around the sun and warp us back 38 minutes Or, we’ll just crawl into the station half an hour late while the app said nothing all along. Good job. Next time I’ll crawl on my hands and knees and prolly get there faster."

A commercial train experience.We took Amtrak from NYC to Niagra. So, while on our way back to NYC at the Niagra Amtrack, we had to wait outside the Amtrack station. It was 2 in the morning weather being as bad as - 10 degree Celsius. The station was closed and would function from 3 am was written on the door which I would prefer to be mentioned on the website. We had to call the Police for assistance as our hands and feet were starting to feel numb.

Amtrak interface is awful in the app, and i have to search for hours how to apply the rail pass that i've just bought for xmas (your marketing team is on point). It's not in the same app for rail pass, i have to go to website and somehow seek to apply it. Most people are giving reviews about attendants being rude, or train being late but everyone understands, if there is a snow storm for example, the tracks will be so snowed down that the train can't pass, it's kind of common sense. And yes people working for you are often rude, i'm used to that and it's not the problem with me at all. Your very system is awful, i cannot book a ticket with rail pass.

242,trustpilot.com,"March 13th from Washington dc to Orlando Florida.  As soon as I got to the door of the train I could smell URINE coming from the inside. The seats are large and there is a good leg room. Attendants do their job as well as they can because there's only a couple of them for the entire trip. The bathroom have small space between toilet and sink, an oversized person can not fit, bathroom floors have URINE,  I'm sure its all over walls also because as a male is using it the train shakes around. People bring in all kinds of food and prepare meals at their seats so the smell of chicken, doritos, tuna takes over the whole car. Prices are comparable to airfare. There was one worker cleaning all bathrooms on all cars. She is an overworked employee and was very pleasant."
243,trustpilot.com,"It's hard to express how rude and dismissive the customer service representative I spoke with today at Amtrak was. It was shocking. Amtrak made an error (twice now) and I asked her to hold for ONE minute while I got the information requested (again) and after waiting an HOUR to speak with them, and when I said I was getting it she just dropped my call and put me back at the beginning of the hold queue. It was unbelievable."

He’s a keeper."
245,trustpilot.com,"The Wifi hardly worked at all the entire time I spent traveling. I was hoping to get some work done, or at least enjoy music and TV on my computer, but could not due to the faulty Wifi. Much less likely to travel with Amtrak going forward, as the whole point in choosing a longer but more comfortable travel method is to enjoy the convenience a nd resources, which I was shorted this time around. Airplane Wifi comes at a fee, but at least it works! Amtrak is not a reliable option for those traveling for business and/or trying to be productive during their time traveling."

I am writing my congressional reps to insist they stop funding this corrupt and poorly run service. Amtrak should go away and let private organizations run and improve our rail systems."

No one can answer my question, I have called three times, agents are lazy, short with you and very unhelpful. None of them are super friendly either. They just sound like they’re there because they have to be and they’re definitely working from home because a dog was barking in the background the whole time I was trying to speak with , the agent today. They won’t give me the room for that price either makes no sense. Super frustrating!"

250,trustpilot.com,I traveled from ft Lauderdale to  NC for a funeral on January 25 2023. Service from employee on train was terrible. Me and my daughter ate food at cafe on train which was too expensive and today I received an email stating food was contaminated. Possible listeria. Could I sue Amtrak? My stomach has been feeling queasy with headaches. I should go to the doctor and Amtrak should be sued and shutdown for serving contaminated food. BAD SERVICE
251,trustpilot.com,"I had two sudden deaths in my immediate family back to back. I went on their website to book a last minute train home to be with my family. I found a super cheap fare and immediately booked it because under the circumstances I am strapped for cash. When I went to check out my total almost tripled! I went back redid the process and again the same thing. I restarted my phone and then tried to book on another device! Again, the same exact thing happened. I took screenshots of the fare being displayed and what happens at checkout and then contacted Amtrak for assistance. I was met with the most insensitive, disgusting and extremely rude rep I have ever encountered. He wouldn’t even allow me to explain the situation after being on hold for an entire hour! He then hung up on me without hearing what issues I was experiencing and without helping me at all. I was forced to call back and have been currently on hold for an hour and 15 minutes and counting! Truly sad and disgusting the way that they treat their customers. To act rude and disgusting towards someone that is grieving is unacceptable! True, he may not have know my situation but why should a customer SERVICE agent need to know a person’s personal circumstances in order to show decency and kindness or to provide the necessary support that your customers need?? Truly disappointed!! Although on my end it’s still displaying the cheaper fare, I was told that Amtrak will not honor what I’m seeing as it only matters what they can see. And the only explanation that they could offer me as to why I’m seeing the lower fare is because “the system must be updating” I have several screenshots and have made several attempts to retry it. They offered no type of compassion nor sympathy for what I’ve been enduring on their website! The fare is not the issue, the issue is that its being advertised as a certain amount and of course I’m going to go with the cheaper option but they’re not honoring it which proves they lack integrity!"
252,trustpilot.com,Rode 765 on 12/7 at 9:26 to Sta Barbara and returned 12/9 on 4784.  There were four of us traveling.  The crew was so friendly and helpful!  The conductor had an xceptional voice and made each stop fun!  On return trip train was full and we ended up sitting apart.  When the conductor saw this he told us there were four seats together on another cart and took us there.  We were so grateful!! All of the crew was great!
253,trustpilot.com,"No doubt Amtrak could improve.  But then again, couldn't we all.  That is, many paying passengers do not get, ""It takes 2 to tango"":  What one  puts out is what comes back.  If you're a jerk, jerk is what you'll get in return. What you sew is what you reap. But there are those that believe otherwise. Habitually, they treat others, particularly service folks, like garbage.  Hence, what they see is a garbage world. Try smiling genuinely while asking the Amtrak folks, ""How's your day?"" Guaran ball bearin, It'll change that world within which you roam."

Yes, at times it feels it takes for ever to reach a destination, but one has the opportunity to enjoy the scenery and, at least in my experience, very nice travel companions. Amtrak personnel I interacted have always been diligent and provided me with good service. It is perhaps about how we approach service providers. Yes, one pay for service, but that does not mean one can expect to be treated with courtesy and respect unless one treats others right. Yes, I consider Amtrak to be an American unpolished gem. And for individuals who complain about Amtrak prices evidently they have been living in a shell. Thank you Amtrak!!"

The lady at the ticket desk would not let me on even though I bought tickets. She said they were only accepting Amtirack tickets and they had sold out. A total lie. Amtrack has a history of bribery and embezzlement. They claim the train is sold out. However, this is a dirty trick they play on holiday weekends to limit the number of people on the train."

Checked the suitcase before leaving terminal and discovered the theft. Clerks there were unhelpful and unapologetic.  Had to drag information out of them about what to do and who to call. There is NO manager at the Fresno station, just a bunch of clerks who don’t know who their manager is or a phone number to reach them.  I am very angry!!  TRAVELER BEWARE!"
257,trustpilot.com,There was a very young girl in the train with a small dog in a crate.  The dog wasn’t happy and wined occasionally but it really wasn’t that bad.  No one cared.

Everyone on the train car booed the employee for his arrogant behavior .

266,trustpilot.com,"Hello, the lack of customer service and humanity that Amtrak's employees chose to exhibit to women who could be anyone's senior relative, is appalling. It showed a lack of discernment and concern for the safety of women, who were kicked off the train, in what looks like the middle of nowhere, in the cold. Make it make sense? Would you have done this to elderly women who were not black?"
267,trustpilot.com,"From reading these reviews, it looks like Amtrak should hire European train professionals who know how to treat customers. Conductors, and ticket collectors are employees of Amtrak and at the service of the clients who pay their fare. They are not the police, should not be authoritarian and should ALWAYS put the customer's needs first. Period."

It was so late the Amtrak train behind it was set to pass it. We asked if we could change our ticket to get on that one (a routine thing in developed countries) it would cost us $85 to so. In the process I learned Stamford is the end of the line for the NYC lines. So we'll be using that instead. Amtrak is too unreliable to use for regular use.

When these things happen, there's no estimate for how long a fix will take, and in one case the just turned the train around and gave up. The entire process is error prone and wholely unreliable - I would not recommend using Amtrak unless it's your only method of transport."

Yes the train is old but if you go with the right expectations in that respect, you can’t help but be in awe of the journey and the scenery and the service, all of which we’re magnificent. We had a family roomer which was perfect for the four of us. Roman, our room attendant was kind, helpful and funny and made our trip what it was… excellent. The service on the dining car and the food was just what we needed after a transatlantic flight from the UK (special thanks to Dan for getting to know us and what we needed) and the scenery we got to see from our dual aspect windows was breathtaking. Know that you’re not going on a luxury train (because it’s not) and be ok with that, and sit back and enjoy the ride."

He told her she had to go upstairs. I said she cannot go upstairs and he repeated himself so I repeated myself a little firmer and louder and told him that she is handicapped.

No apology no compensation no access to restaurant. Cafe food not great, toilets in coach class almost disgusting and Zephyr certainly not the most picturesque train ride in the US( as advertised) . Did get our money back from the difference though but suspect the travel agent had some influence. Coastal Starlight to Seattle in roomette with pleasant staff and really good food. Be careful if booking long haul Amtrak trains they WILL cancel at short notice due to lack of staff as we found out by speaking to people."

I do not want to spend my entire vacation on the train. Goodbye."
288,trustpilot.com,Amtrak  canceled my train and left me stranded in California. Before that we arrived at train stations up to eight hours late. It cost me $257 to fly home and all Amtrak would do was give me a $33 rebate on the two segments of my ticket I didn’t use. Along with $50 for my inconvenience. Of course it’s in the form of an Amtrak voucher that I have to use within a year. typical government run program. I never will take an Amtrak train again!!
289,trustpilot.com,"Our train was supposed to arrive at 3:30, delayed until 3:44. After we boarded we sat down and told us they they'd be closing cars down in DC. The train is packed full of people and you close down cars?! We were forced to go to business class to sit but couldn't stay there. So where would you like us to sit? Great at being consistently terrible."
290,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak service workers and train conductors are so ridiculous unfriendly and extremely rude to customers.   They don’t even want to help with heavy bags and when asking for help they said we should do it ourselves.  The trains are always late, the bathroom is filthy and smells."
291,trustpilot.com,"For the ""trains safety"", it had to stop mid trip during a snowstorm,  My daughter and three grandchildren under six years old had to walk 40 minutes in 14° weather through unplowed streets to get to a hotel. Amtrak did nothing for my family."
292,trustpilot.com,"Got late call the train I was suppose to take was canceled due to mud slides, ok with the weather,  it happens. Unacceptable to me was on immediately trying to call customer service,  I have so far spent over 3 hours trying to get thru to them, trying again this morning, but will go down the station this morning to deal with it."
293,trustpilot.com,This company is a fraud. I booked a $509 trip back in June 2022 (with the travel protection policy making sure my tickets were refundable should I cancel).Cancelled trip July 2022. We are going into October and I still haven't seen a dime of my money back. The issued me a cash refundable eVoucher but refuse to give me my cash back. The representatives are all RUDE on the phone. Pretend not to hear you when the call. They closed out my online tickets to contact them via email without addressing the issue. Do not travel with this fraudulent company.
294,trustpilot.com,"Took California Zephyr from Chicago to Denver and then back to Chicago.  First leg we were 1 1/2 hours delayed.  Trip from Denver to Chicago nearly 3 hours delayed.  Had to ask why was told due to freight traffic no one bothered to tell us anything on why it’s delayed.  I am typing this as we wait.  This is our first experience on traveling by train and it will be our last.  Between the delays and the uncomfortable roomettes, which are not cheap, we won’t ever do this again. Finally got on the train and not one word why it was delayed and not one word why we left Denver nearly an hour later.  Saw a mechanic working on the train and realized there was no freight traffic it was a mechanical issue.  I think there still may be an issue since this train is moving so slow.  Amtrak needs to do better!!!"
295,trustpilot.com,After Amtrak kicked off 2 elderly women in the middle of a once in a generation storm and then strand them with a dog who couldn't help that they needed to potty is beyond the pale. I'm am disgusted to the bottom of my soul. I hope those women and the dog they stranded are ok. Ill never do business with this company nor will any of my friends and family. This will travel far and wide Amtrak. There is nothing they could do or offer to make this right. Disgusting company!
296,trustpilot.com,"Thank you Claud, Michael, and Ernesto. As well as the whole Chicago staff. You guys rock and made our experience amazing. We cannot wait for our return trip!!"
297,trustpilot.com,Old and dirt seats. Toilets were stinking. No help or assistance to be found when needed. Backward seats awkward!
298,trustpilot.com,"We are 4 hours behind schedule, a lot of us have been on this train for a day and night already, (it's hard enough to sleep on a train as it is) we are all exhausted, yet since 7:30 this morning we've had Chatty Cathy every 10  minutes on the intercom telling us ALL  about the sites. Some of us might like it but the rest of us would really like sleep more!! Very rude and inconsiderate since most of us pay a lot of money for these tickets and would like some kind of peace and  Makes no sense to make everybody wear headphones if she's going to be yacking just to hear her own voice. Can somebody please make some sense out of that for me?! I had no idea I would have to put up with this when buying my ticket, or I wouldn't have...I would have paid less money to go Greyhound knowing I was going to get no rest because of rooting and considerate passengers, instead of paying more money, and getting less rest, because of one very very rude and inconsiderate employee who loves the sound of her own voice.REFUND! REFUND!! REFUND!!!"
299,trustpilot.com,Going from San Diego to Camarillo. The transfer bus is anything but comfortable. Rude employees. Rude drivers. Rude all around. Tickets should be way less for the huge inconvenience  and unprofessional behavior. Staff is awful on the transfer.
300,trustpilot.com,"So a few months ago my family and I went on a round trip from Philadelphia to New York City. We had booked business class tickets, yet they don’t let you pick your seats. As a result, the four of us were all separated in the train. This creepy guy came and sat next to me and kind of had his hand outside of his seat area. The seats were big so I was definitely not accidental. We got off after but I feel if we didn’t, he would have groped me. So that is how seriously Amtrak takes the safety of passengers.Another major safety issue: NO SECURITY. Like NONE. No metal detectors, no bag checks. Anyone can just take whatever bombs or weapons they want and no one is stopping them.Yeah so this is basically a nutshell of how Amtrak cares about our safety. Definitely would not suggest Amtrak, especially if you are traveling with young children as like I said, you will all be separated."
301,trustpilot.com,The room attendant was great . He took my lunch order 1230 pm but when I got to pick up my lunch I felt like I was in begging line ? The attitude of the server was rude and totally unacceptable . He treated guess like he was the one giving it to us . Very not polite how can Amtrak hire people and allow such lack of courtesy .
302,trustpilot.com,"Ride to destination was great! Crew were friendly and polite, the accommodations were comfortable, and travel was smooth. Return trip was on time, unfortunately Conductor K. Williams made a negative first impression with her offensive approach to addressing young passengers. Quick to assert authority when no challenge was posed, family member was simply given incorrect instructions from other crew. Amtrak is great, appreciate their courtesy and care, wish Conductor K. Williams had made a better first impression."
303,trustpilot.com,I would like to understand how you kicked two elderly black ladies and their dog off your train before their destination!!! This is a disgusting racist act! Amtrak should be ashamed of how these ladies where treated.
304,trustpilot.com,Trip from hell.  Over 3 hours late arriving.  I agree with others a bus ride would have been much better.  If you are going to ride the rails go to Europe.   Avoid Amtrak at all costs.
305,trustpilot.com,"For the last 36 hours, intermittantly, I have been trying to book a one way ticket from Wilmington, DE to Baltimore Penn Station.   The Amtrak website is terrible.  It sends me in a circle; I put down that I want a 1 way ticket and it reverts back to ""round trip"", the computer generated assistant comes on and then redirects you somewhere else.  The site offers a $15.00 ticket but once you get re-routed, you may wind up paying $55.00 for a ticket.  With all the money we pay for Rail fare, you would think they had enough money to pay a knowledgeable website designer to come up with something that works.  As it is now, Amtrak may as well be functioning as it did in 1822; I still have to go to the ornery desk clerk to purchase a ticket to ride."
306,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak only lists one address as a bus stop in Healdsburg, and put an amtrak sign up on that stop and that stop only. Because of this, I assumed that was the bus stop to wait at. Turns out it wasn't. It was the stop across the street that did not have an amtrak sign on it but had a sonoma county transit sign. I even called amtrak to confirm and they told me the address of the stop I was waiting at is the bus stop, said something else I couldn't fully hear and then hung up abruptly. Anyway, I wound up missing my amtrak bus home because they gave me incorrect information on where to wait at and made things as confusing and frustrating as possible. I was stranded and couldn't make it home because of them, costing me an extra 300 dollars for a hotel. I am disabled and low income. 300 isn't pocket change for me and money that could have gone a long way. Absolutely terrible experience from Amtrak."

308,trustpilot.com,I traveled on Amtrak for 3days me and my little service dog we traveled from NC to Spokane WA we had a roomette  the food was great the service was top self. i recommend Amtrak  to all if you have time to sit back and enjoy Amtrak is the way to go .....THANK YOU AMTRAK...
309,trustpilot.com,"Folks, Amtrack sucks. While there is no traffic like when you are traveling in a car, the company can't organize timely arrival and departure. Delays, engine problems, café problems...If you must use Amtrack, there is a big chance you will be late like we are on our flight from Newark Airport.Keep it in mind!"
310,trustpilot.com,"The worst experience I’ve ever had in my life. Not only did there food made me sick no one checked on us to see if we needed medical attention no conductor nothing, but the train was  8hours late to my destination after it was suppose to be a 17 train ride turned out to be 22 hours . They did not say or explained why the train was late. They only offer microwaveable burgers and microwaveable Mac and cheese. Warning Do not eat that is what made me sick. Then when the train finally arrived 8hours late they had us wait inside the train cart for 1hour without air conditioning food or water. To make a long story short DONT ever ride Amtrak they will take your money you will be late yo your destination and they will not reimburse you for your money. Save yourself the aggravation and just fly or drive.Go somewhere else they only want your money."
311,trustpilot.com,"First of all our train was 6 hours late, bumping us from a 9:30 PM start to 3:30 AM.  Many people missed their connections.  We rode from Nevada to Chicago (and back 2 weeks later)  The train was dirty.  The bathroom didn't seem to be cleaned for 2 days either direction.  Amtrak is also very slow.  I figure we averaged 40 mph.  In today's world with high-speed trains all over the world there is no excuse for this.  I can understand going slow through mountains, but in the desert and mid-west plains, no excuse not to be traveling at 200 mph.  The infrastructure needs to be changed.  Take money from wars and paying off student debt and put it in to transportation, specifically passenger trains.  The fellow passengers were good for the most part, but it only takes a handful of noisy, rude people to make life miserable.  We had our share of those including a lady doing her Chinese lessons on her phone at 6 AM!  The food in the dining car was only available to sleeper car passengers due to lack of staff.  The food in the snack bar was OK, but expensive.  The staff were mostly kind and helpful."
312,trustpilot.com,"amtrak is awful. why the us has such a horrible train system  is a mystery but it is the worst. Late, rude,dirty. we were stuck outside of chicago for a couple of hours because of other trains or at least that was the excuse  given.  the train was late into st louis as well"
313,trustpilot.com,Our recent trip was really nice we were comfortable and made the time go by fast. A good experience
314,trustpilot.com,"We paid over $400 for return travel from Boston to New York. Outward trip was fine. Returning from New York the train was over 3 hours late, no explanation or assistance we all had to sit on the station floor. When it did arrive there were too many people for the train, and we were forced to give a guard $50 cash to get us on the train, that we had paid so much for. The train was so late we missed our onward trip and dinner with family. I complained about the whole experience and their staff demanding cash at the station, I've had no reply at all to my e-mails which were now 2 weeks ago. I asked for a refund and a explanation why their staff were allowed to demand cash, and if they knew that was happening Awful company and customer service. made the British Rail system seem efficient !"
315,trustpilot.com,"You know, any company seems fine when nothing goes wrong; you see what a company really is when you have to contact hem with an issue.  I've been on the phone for over 1 1/2 hours so far talked to one person who was just an overflow and could not do anything, and was hung up on Twice before I could even tell them what my issue was...    The issue; their web site somehow switched my return date to a different  day when booking my ticket.  The web site only has bots that  are useless, the help line has way to small  of a useful window for a company that  goes from coast to coast (their phone support is about the same as the 6 branch one county bank I worked  at), and they are set up to waste your time so that by the time you get a refund it will cost you more in time than the value of what ever money you could get back from them."
316,trustpilot.com,"I don't know where to begin, for starters the website didn't work properly and when I called them they had raised the price by $50 dollars, but this was only the beginning of my descent into hell. If you thought the people at the DMV were bad wait until you meet the Amtrak staff—the station attendant seemed to want to inject the very air around him with misery, curt, rude and hating life. The rest of the staff seemed to strive to be as arrogant, condescending and put upon as humanly possible (my God your a glorified usher don't treat people like chattle). Not to pile on but the car stinks, looks and feels dirty, not just dirty unsanitary, in has all the charm of a downtown bus stop replete with people sleeping on the floor. Terrible. What a simply terrible experience. Don't give them money. And if you do have to take this purgatory on wheels make sure to bring your own food, $7.50 for a microwaved cheese burger, and they expect—I mean it they expect you to tip. Please avoid, public transportation in this country needs an overhaul."
317,trustpilot.com,"Arrived in San Francisco following a great stay on the California Zephyr however, arrival in Emeryville was chaotic, especially trying to get our bags out of the hold, and the very unhelpful coach attendant. On arrival in SF we were dumped in the middle of nowhere, in a dark poorly lit  neighbourhood with no way to get to our hotels as we were too far from the main tourist drag with no taxis/buses around. As everyone drifted away we were left on our own with a dangerous aggressive man near us & it was terrifying - I was in tears. We only made it safely to our hotel thanks to a couple from the train we bumped into who were in the same situation but had eventually managed to get a taxi & their driver called us another cab - even he was worried about leaving us standing there in the dark. This needs to change urgently for people's safety."
318,trustpilot.com,"This was my first time using Amtrak, and it was a horrible experience with their customer service department! I waited for 45 minutes to talk to someone to have my trip canceled, and the woman was curt with me and refused to give me a full refund. I was given only $48 and a voucher out of the $140 that I spent. I was also charged $16. Absolutely ridiculous."
319,trustpilot.com,Amtrak sold me and my mother a ticket when we got to the station to depart for our trip they cancelled  and said no more trips we're going out this week How can they take our money? We had to $150 more to ride the bus any order to get to our destination Been up since 4:3am it's 5.22 and we are just leaving
320,trustpilot.com,"I was so excited to take the train from Vancouver to Seattle when I noticed it was working again.The experience was terrible from the beginning till the end. The train conductor & immigration officers were extremely rude, talking to us like some lower class, evidently looking down on us and thinking we were stupid. I don't see why I should put up with that attitude after paying $200 for the trip. We are your clients who pay for your salary, so please re-adjust how you're talking to us!To top it all, we ended up in Bellingham because of some issues on the railway & were told that we could either go back to Vancouver (After 2hrs on the train? Thank you very much!), or find our own means of transport. Which I did, it's just that it cost me another US$100, and I still wait to see my refund from Amtrak! Not speaking of that I purposefully chose to travel by train to enjoy the train ride; if I knew I would have to take a bus, I would have never gone. So next time - no thank you."

322,trustpilot.com,The worst trip ever. Missed our train home due to being in a blizzard & no way to get to train asked to reschedule & was told we had to forfeit our ticket & puchase a new one. We only paid 300.00 for round trip & was charged 452.00 for just one way to get home. Toilets were overflowing on the train & it was filthy dirty. Both stations were unmanned & doors were locked were left out in the cold to wait. Terrible customer relations. They offered a voucher but not a refund. I would NEVER ride on another Amtrak train even if I was paid so why would I want a voucher.

324,trustpilot.com,"A continuation of my previous review. The City of New Orleans ran out of coffee at 11am this morning, most food choices were missing as well. I expected that Amtrak would have a dining car but they eliminated the car. When I get home I will be contacting my congressional representatives and request funding for this unimaginably mismanaged company be eliminated. I am disgusted that my tax dollars are currently funding this transit nightmare."
325,trustpilot.com,"Worst experience ever. Booked a room on way down to Sanford for extra $. It was so small, like a cracker box but was the best they had. Ac didn't work as they override it and we froze all night. Then you have to walk multiple cars to get to dinner. Food was good but hallways are tight and leak water on you when rain happens. Bathroom was impossibly small and tough to get into at an angle. And we were supposed to shower when sitting on commode? On way back we arrived at 1:30 to find out they gave away our roomette and moved us 4 train cars back. We asked why and they said we do this all the time to accommodate families. We had a reservation for a specific room and car!!! We can't go to dinner as it's too far for my knee to handle( due for replacement). Any hope of a good experience is completely gone. Amtrak operations are subpar and we will NEVER do this again- I could have been a great passenger multiple trips but the travel option of train will never be selected again. So be warned this is not great!"
326,trustpilot.com,"Our train was delayed and we missed our following train (both on the same ticket). The next proposed train was after 7 hours. For a 7 hours journey, the total journey would have been 14 hours. We asked staff on train about the policy, they were nice but incompetent in matters related to delay. Ground staff the same. Only option was to call Amtrak. We wasted 1h45 minutes on wait on the call, but no reply. We decided to take a taxi and pay 200$. Amtrak didn't refund our taxi fare where ground staff had told us it could be possible that we would be refunded. Please allow a lot of extra time if you want to use Amtrak service."

I will also tell any and all people to stay away from you! What you did was a crime.

331,trustpilot.com,That video of them calling the police to kick 2 elderly black ladies off the train bc their dog pooped and they cleaned up after their dog…. Is so disgusting. Left these 2 ladies and their dog stranded on the side of the road on Christmas Eve!??? Amtrak should be filled with absolute shame. Why allow dogs on the train then? Will never use you and will tell everyone I know to avoid Amtrak bc they are RACIST. Either against old black ladies or little dogs.
332,trustpilot.com,Amtrak is a great way to get places. Have to give 5 stars to Sheri and Ed. They had to deal with people that thought they could choose to sit where they wanted to and have other move that had been on the train for a while already. Sheri and Ed you both dealt with it very professionally. I've ridden the Amtak many times and staff has always been friendly and well mannered.
333,trustpilot.com,"Train cancelled & stranded in Chicago with no other train options 3/25. Had to stay an extra night in the hotel and rent a car to drive back 8 hours 3/26. We spent over $600 to get home when our train tickets were $120 total. We could have flown back home with tickets easily under $150 each if we booked when we initially scheduled the trip. We chose to take the train back home to enhance our journey and have a relaxing journey home. This turned into a nightmare when Amtrak cancelled 3 hours before departure, all other train options were booked or cancelled, all flights were either booked or $500 per ticket and no car rentals were available until the next day. The relaxing train journey turned into an extra $600 expense with 8 hours of driving. Amtrak was not able to provide any assistance during the day the train was cancelled. Tickets were refunded and told to call Monday when Customer Service is open. Called Monday & waited on hold for over an hour. Customer service offered $100 voucher for use within 1 year & directed me to contact corporate via email for a response in 6-8 weeks. Customer rep advised that they do not have a supervisor when asked to speak with someone above them. Rep advised that only method for going forward is contacting corporate. I no longer feel comfortable traveling with Amtrak in the future now that I know the customer service response. Amtrak will do nothing or will not provide any assistance if you are stranded. They do not care. Would leave a 0/5 stars if possible."

336,trustpilot.com,"This was our first and last time riding Amtrak. The first leg of our trip was great. The ride, service and views were amazing. On our return trip from Salt Lake City we received notification 36 hours prior to departure that our train was delayed due to weather. Completely understandable with mountain snows. I continued to check the train status on the Amtrak app every few hours. At 4:00am and again at 6:20am on the day of departure I spoke with customer service and was told that the train was still delayed and would not arrive until at least 5:00pm. At 7:10am I again checked the status to see if it was delayed or service disrupted as it had gone back and forth between these two things. It said our train was in SLC and departing in less than 30 minutes. I called customer service in the way to the station and they confirmed (after 20 minutes) that yes we were supposed to be on that train. Arrived at the station but was denied boarding because the train was already closed. Tried to explain the situation but got no where. The train sat there for another 20 minutes before leaving. Shame on Amtrak for such awful communication and shame on the station staff for such lack of compassion when it was there fault!! It’s sad that this happened because had our return trip been like of one going to SLC Amtrak would have gotten 5 stars"

340,trustpilot.com,"Horrible experience today. I had purchased a round trip from BWI to Newark and paid a premium as I guess it is Spring break. They did not scan my ticket on the way up. I didn’t think anything of it- the conductor just seemed busy and disorganized. When I got in my seat for the return trip, someone else said it was their seat and their ticket showed the same seat as me. When the conductor scanned it, he said mine was cancelled as there was no record of me doing the first leg of the trip. The return ticket was still showing in my app, no one contacted me to ask if I had done the first leg or even to tell me they had cancelled the return ticket (who just arbitrarily cancels a ticket someone has paid for) so I had no idea before getting on the train. When I explained the situation to the conductor and said it was cancelled in error- he got annoyed at me and said rudely  - “you need to move as you are in HIS seat” referring to the other passenger. I actually had to tell him to remain nice as this was not my fault and I am being moved from MY seat due to their error. I then had to spend an hour standing up in the cafe car calling the 1800 number (that is how long their wait was) to get them to allocate me a new seat- which they did. My train was the 6.15 from Newark  (2169) to Washington DC and it was a male conductor speaking to me this way- if Amtrak reads this, I really hope you speak to him and remind him to be courteous to your customers. Also, please do not just cancel tickets without clarifying a situation or speaking to a customer."
341,trustpilot.com,"I am disappointed in my Amtrak train experience. I’d been looking forward to my first overnight train experience for months. The views over the Rockies on the California Zephyr were great! But if you need to sleep, you don’t want to be on this train. It is rare for me to get motion sickness but sleeping on the top bunk on the top level of the sleeper car made me feel like I had been shaken violently for hours. And the loudness of the train whistle (which blew all night long through Nebraska) was way too close to the sleeper cars. If you need to get to your destination anywhere close to on-time, especially to make a connection, you don’t want to be on this train. Our train ride back home started 2 hrs late, (which we received no notification of) and we arrived back in Chicago four hours late. Our train ride there was 1.5 hours late. If you are trying to save money by taking the train, think again and don’t take this train. Even making our reservations 4 months ahead of time, pricing is so expensive for what you get. The bathrooms were not kept clean. By the second day, the trash bins were overflowing. On the upside, the staff was friendly and helpful. The conductors’ commentary was often delightful. The other passengers were fun to get to know. The food was OK. Bottom line - This was our first and will be our last trip on Amtrak."
342,trustpilot.com,"This is the worst experience that I’ve had with Amtrak. I will never use them again. First I booked a trip from St. Paul to Chicago, at 1:00am I was notified that the train will be 3hrs delayed which will arrive at 10:30am. When I got to the station at 9:30am I was told that the train will be delayed until after 3:00pm. I’m so upset that I had to spend money for a Uber there and back home and I live 40mins away from the station. You should’ve just cancel the damn train ride for the damn day. And because of Amtrak I missed visiting my father in the hospital."
343,trustpilot.com,"After I'd agreed on the price for my ticket, I put in my payment details. It then wouldn't let me pay and said a portion of my trip was no longer available. It wouldn't way which portion. When I tried to pay again by opening a new page, it had doubled the price of the exact same ticket. This doesn't seem fair. A deal is a deal."
344,trustpilot.com,Would much rather drive even. They left me stranded with 3 train cancellations without much warning. I was one my way to the train station each time. Not only that it’ll most likely be like 3-4 late both ways.
345,trustpilot.com,"Never got a lunch, no complimentary water, the staff were rude and make minimal effort and acted like the passengers are an inconvenience and a chore. They didn't try to make a pleasant environment at all or offer good service especially with roomettes where you're paying a lot of money. Sorry but isn't it your job as an attendant to see to the needs of your passengers? Lots of miscommunication and no organization. I don't think I will take it again.Recommendations from a first time passenger: if you announce breakfast is first come first serve and there's.plenty of open tables for you to choose from, then don't act like the passenger and came in and sat down at an open table is carrying a bomb. If the rules are you have to wait at the doorway regardless.of.reservation or first come first serve then clearly state that. Or better, put a sign in front of the entry door to remind people. But freaking out and yelling is unprofessional and uncalled for.A small pamphlet of good to know FAQs would be good to put in each room. Such as what to call your attendant using the light for. Sleeper passengers are told their attendant will come by around meal times to take orders and see if you want it delivered to the room or make a reservation. Ether they do that or the passenger has to call them to their room. Which one is it?? Showing the schedules of when things are open are nice too such as cafe times and if the sight seer lounge has closing times."
346,trustpilot.com,"First, I am unable to enter the correct date here--September, 2022.We thought we would try a new adventure--no plane this time.  VERY bad decision.  Late train leg by hours; poor, insensitive communication about helping with luggage and distances from hotels to train or bus depots;  multiple stops of bus legs to the point of being unbearable; incredibly poor communication about a cancelled leg because of strike that created a very stressful situation while on one leg-+no help to alleviate the stress by making other arrangements or even offering to get us home or whatever--nothing; we had to make shuttle arrangements, hotel reservations, and plane flight arrangements to get back on track; unguarded luggage at the exits of the train, no monitoring of who is taking luggage--whether it is theirs or not, lies about bed sizes; poor communication about which stop is our stop--could have been taken further without us knowing, no personal touch; allowing suspect people with mental health and personal hygiene issues on the  train with healthy, sane folks, rude personnel, including bus drivers on carryover legs; being forced to sit with people that we did not know at a table for dinner because the waiters did not want multiple tables being used--we could NOT sit alone and have a quiet, private meal--UNBELIEVABLE!!!   We wouldn't get monetary satisfaction without being forced to buy travel insurance about their foul-ups.  It took over three months to get some remuneration due to the debacle.  Again difficult, insensitive communication.   And this company is a federally owned??!!   We could go on!!!"

348,trustpilot.com,I payed shy of $500 for traveling on Amtrak from Reno Nevada to Chicago Illinois . I went to the bathroom on the Amtrak after noticing bug bites on my arm and crazy itching all over. When I lifted my clothing… I saw a bunch of bright red bed bug bites. I just couldn’t handle the itching. I reported to driver and another worker. I showed them bites and some photos I took in the bathroom of bites. One of the workers took my name and number. The driver said to contact Amtrak and that they would reimburse me and that they were sorry. I’ve been trying to reach a supervisor by phone and email and nobody is responding. My husband had to drive to the small town of Osceola Iowa to get me. I just wanted to shower and get out of what I was wearing. I had to get off the train and didn’t even go to Chicago anymore. I was supposed to spend the weekend in Chicago with my husband and instead we went stair home after being picked up. I’ve showered like 4 times since yesterday morning and I’m still itchy. I tried applying ointments and it’s not helping.

352,trustpilot.com,"I am a very disappointed and dissatisfied customer. I ride Amtrak twice a week, every week. There are several times when the train is late, and I miss my ride to my destination and many times miss my connecting train, to my destination. Today I was 2 late because there was an accident on Route 66 in VA which is my route to catch Silver line, which is my first train to union station in Washington DC. Unfortunately I had to arrive at union Station in Washington DC 2 minutes to my train departure time. My was 138 and departure time was 6:05, I arrived 6:03 and was told I can’t go because the doors are closed. I was referred to the ticket department, met the first customer service woman, who told me I will have to pay a huge amount for the difference with the next train. I asked if there is anything she can do, she asked me to wait for the supervisor. She clearly told me with a tight voice that she cannot do anything for me. Now I have been charged an additional fee of $108.00 with no remorse from the supervisor.  she told me there nothing she can do and I will have to pay $108.00 for a later train or refund my money. I cannot believe what she said, I think she thinks I am just riding the train for fun. I told her I can’t cancel my trip because I have to be at work. Even when I told her I am a frequent rider and there had been times when the train is late and ended up missing my connecting train or ride, all she said was, I should have called for compensation which, just like not knowing that the doors closed 2 minutes to departure time, I don’t know I should call any time my train is delayed. I called customer relations and stayed on the phone for over an hour. I had to hang up and write this review. This is very heart rendering. The customer service is too poor. They act like they are God, they posses too much power and talk to customer in a very rude manner. I am writing for customer relations to look into my issue and refund me the $108.00 that I have been charged. I hope this issue would be looked at seriously. Thank you"

356,trustpilot.com,"I have round trip tickets from Fresno to San Juan Capistrano. From Fresno to SJC was great. Every staff member was wonderful.I got to LA for my return and was in a long line to board my bus to get over the grapevine.A few of us got up to the front of the line and were told ""This bus is full, you need to get on ""that"" bus (points to a bus with a forming line.) Instead of having the last 4 of us get to the break of the second line, he walks off, leaving us to now get in a second long line to get on the bus. No courtesy at all. He did not say what bus was what,  nothing useful. So in line we go. I get up to the front, people are moving fairly well, so good, but I missed the area to place my bag. The same staff member, customer service, I found out, was sitting down watching us, not helping with bags to make more room o. The edges. I put mine in the space, I slipped it under a portable barrier because otherwise I would have had to lift it over a concrete bench. This customer service rep got angry and said something unintelligible- while sitting. I said ""I don't want to have to get out of another long line, sorry"" He became very confrontational and said ""Did you say something?"" I repeated my statement, and he said ""Next time I say to put your luggage around the barrier, for safety, do it, or you won't get on my bus.""I gave him a thumbs up. Such horrible service from one man who basically sat on his butt the whole time. I am trying to feel sad for him, he must be miserable. But I am a paying customer and he should have been trained for his position to be helpful and courteous. Or go dig ditches."
357,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak is HORRIBLE!!  If I didn't hate flying, I would never take them.  I needed to modify a reservation.  I attempted to do it online, but the website doesn't let you change locations, just date/time.  So i called and waited for 15 minutes to get a person.  I got halfway through the conversation with her, and all of a sudden I was punted to their auto-survey.  So this time I decided to just cancel my trip online, take the penalty and create a new reservation.  I created my new reservation and right as I completed adding in all of the information including the passenger info and credit card information, it told me that my train was sold out.  Why wouldn't it show me that when I was choosing the itinerary??!  So I ended up trying to call again.  Waited for a person and finally got someone.  This time the representative told me that she's having some audio issues on her end and could I please hold.  She came back 5 minutes later and we resumed.  She then interrupted and said she was still having issues, but we decided to press on.  I asked her if there was ANY room on the train that I wanted to get on that was sold out.  She told me that there was a room available but it was $683.  I asked if I could use points and she said ""Oh.  You have to talk to Guest Rewards if you want to use points.  She transferred me, but now I've been on hold for over 30 minutes and still waiting.  Why don't they show all rooms on all trains online?  And if there's a special guest rewards section, why isn't THAT on their website as well?!?!  Stay far far away if you have ANY other alternatives."

360,trustpilot.com,"I decided it would be a good idea to travel via Amtrak from  Hattiesburg, Mississippi to Union Station/Washington, DC and then home to Maryland. The beginning part of the trip was saddened by the death of my eldest sister's husband, us going home to Mississippi Gulf Coast for his funeral.  We had already shipped his body, and wanted to just be around my eldest sister and each other. My son and another sister decided to do the same.  For my son, it would be his first memory of riding in a train. They each received different messages from Amtrak and missed their train.   So they did not travel until Thursday, April 20th.  Their trip was delayed by 4 hours and their experience was so horrible that my son — said, no thanks back to flying. ONE and DONE! The rudeness of the employees was horrible under the circumstances. (Unfortunately, a teenage kid tried to beat the train. My condolences to his family.) My son was on the phone with me and I could hear someone being SO RUDE, I was shocked to learn it was an Amtrak employee speaking like that. She was VERY nasty to the riders, At least she was non discriminatory, as she raised her voice at all of them.  I shocked by what I was over hearing.  I wished I had thought to record her too. Next day, I was enroute and got caught by a CSX train. When I called Amtrak I was informed they were behind schedule, NOT TRUE. I missed my  train on Friday, April 21st. (Unfortunately , I had already turned my rental car in, I was lucky they dropped me off at the train station.) On Saturday, April 22nd, I arrived early and waited for the train. It was my first time paying to ride in the sleeper cars/a Roomette.  I tried to ask the Amtrak employee who came off the train and was standing by the door/gate where I should stand, WOW!(I was trying to ask where should I go for the sleeping cars…get in her line or do I go somewhere else.) The VERY RUDE employee threw her hand up at me, in the motion of shut up, and I did. The hand motion was clear to me and others that I was to shut up, so I did).  (I had two witnesses, the relative and new friend helping me with my luggage.) Well, after saying all aboard, I was like wait!!! The Rude Amtrak employee said she did not know I needed to ask a question or that I was riding the train.  It was a customer that told me where to go to board the sleeper car. Unfortunately, the same RUDE employee, appeared at the sleeper car.  She said I was not listed as a passenger on the train, and therefore I could not board .  No matter what I said, she held firm.I was pretty much begging her to check and insisting that I was on that train.  I checked my email, didn’t see the update but I was verbally inform by an Amtrak employee that my train would have the information.  The RUDE employee told me that I could not ride and pulled up the steps. I just felt so overwhelmed from my BIL's death, missing the train and then not getting on the train. If not for my cousin, I know I would have broken down. On Sunday, April 23, 2023, I was back at the station a 3rd time.  The conductor informed me that my name is very familiar.  I told her you may have seen it listed, since this is my 3rd attempt to ride this train home.I decided to contact Amtrak CS, and file a complaint when I arrived home.  Guess What!  CS also saw my name listed for each day that I was supposed to be on the train.  Both CS and the Conductor referenced my being on the train on Saturday, 22 April.  BTW:  My train was also late arriving into Union Station, we were delayed. On top of everything else. SMH.I waited, but never heard from Amtrak. I filed a complaint with the BBB, again no response.  As of today, Amtrak never responded to the complaint I filed with the BBB in April complaint. I guess their thought is what's one customer even if she did pay for a sleeper care and missed train fees.Amtrak is in the process of starting a passenger train on the Mississippi Gulf Coast (no more Hattiesburg for the Coast people) which would travel directly through my hometown area.  I have been monitoring their progress and so looking forward to Amtrak coming to the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  I may just do like my son, and other Sibs who live outside the Coast said they would be doing.  FLY.  If I change my mind, and do ride Amtrak (Golden rule of the 21st century, a fully charged phone and record/video).I don’t know, what to suggest except to say don’t fire the person, have the person go through customer service training. Honestly, I was really surprised that Amtrak did not respond to my complaint with the BBB.  I am out of suggestions.  Oh well, lesson learned and duly noted."

365,trustpilot.com,"Well, Amtrak just provided me with an experience so bad I will NEVER take the train again. I was supposed to leave Chicago headed to Detroit at 5:50pm last night. I got to the station at 4 to be sure I wasn’t late. I was told at 5 that the train was running a few minutes late. Then at 5:50 we were told it would be there at 7. Seven came and went and they changed the arrival time to 9. Just after 9 we were told that the train was broken down states away and they had no way to get us home. We were stuck in the lobby trying to figure out how to get home. They were less than helpful. I asked if we could get on the next train and the guy said “maybe, go check at the ticket counter.” Then we asked if there might be buses we could take, and his response was “it’s 3 blocks away, walk there and see.” So I was left with having my husband who just worked a 16 hour shift driving 8 hours round trip to get me, and I was worried sick he would fall asleep at the wheel. Eventually they “found parts and put together” a train. So my husband drove 2 hours at 11pm for nothing, and we wasted 5 hours sitting there. We ended up back to Detroit at 4:45 am. I got home at 5:30, and now I get to take care of my sick child and go to work when I don’t even feel safe to function. This ruined yesterday and today for me, I will never use Amtrak again, and I will let everyone who may be thinking of taking the train know just how bad my experience was."
366,trustpilot.com,"We planned an Amtrak vacation over a year in advance for a once in a lifetime experience to travel from Houston up through Chicago and to Boston to see the fall leaves changing colors. I have wanted to do this most of my adult life. My husband set up my first train ride ever to celebrate my birthday, and for what we hoped would be a truly memorable experience. It was, but for all the wrong reasons. We worked with Amtrak vacation planners and spent a fortune for what was sold to us as a first class experiences on Amtrak's sleeper bedrooms with dining cars and a chef to serve us in our bedroom or in the dining car. First thing, we spent 4 hours on a gross, cramped, dirty bus from Houston to Longview to get on the #22 train to Chicago. Then we spent 4.5 hours waiting on hard benches while the train was late. The Amtrak person actually said ""it's late and sometimes they don't even show up, so be prepared."" The service and food on Amtrak were horrid. We wandered around trying to find food every mealtime and the employees were all sitting on their phones yacking with each other. They acted like we didn't exist. Nobody pays any attention to the customers, and if they do, it's like you're an inconvenience. The ""first class"" food is boxed, unrecognizable grossness that has been microwaved to the point that you can't even get it off the plastic plate with the plastic knife. Even airline food is significantly better than the garbage they serve on Amtrak. We both rated it F-; it was that bad, and I mean every meal. The only thing worth asking for is something like yogurt or a soda in a can, which will be warm. Our bedroom #D was disgustingly unclean. There were leftover water bottles and pills on the floor from a previous guest. One bath towel was even covered with mold. The saving grace is the timing of the scenery and catching the fall leaves turning colors. That part is glorious. Sadly, the windows on every bit of the train and all the cars are so dirty that it's hard to see the scenery details through them. I'm writing this after the first segment Houston to Chicago, and so far can't recommend Amtrak to my worst enemy, much less someone I care about. If you're looking to spend hard earned vacation money for a first class experience, don't chose Amtrak."

372,trustpilot.com,"This winter my husband and I decided to visit my family for Christmas. We live in Oregon and they live in Montana. Going into the winter season we knew it would not be safe to drive for the visit because of the mountain passes between here and our destination. At first, we looked at plane tickets and were quickly overwhelmed buy the prices and travel times. We decided to try something different and take the train. At first, all seemed well. We arranged to take the train from Pasco, WA to Whitefish, MT and my father would drive 3 hours to pick us up. Everything was in order.To spare everyone the long story of our travel experience, here are some numbers: 2 cancellations, 13 hours of delays for a distance that can be traveled by car in 6.5 hours, 2 people in the wrong rooms, 5 laps walked on and around the train to find an employee, 29 hours of travel time with 3 hours of sleep, 2.5 hours of the train moving,  2 announcements about travel vs 4 announcements about the dining car, and 11 hours spent sitting in train stations. I do not fault Amtrak for the delays and cancellations. The winter storm with multiple feet of snow and temperatures in some locations reaching 50 below zero was out of their control. However, the lack of communication during the troubleshooting process prevented the passengers from having the opportunity to make informed decisions about their travel plans and potentially make other arrangements was frustrating and could have easily been resolved. My second annoyance with Amtrak is the lack of support when a train is cancelled. Yes, they do offer free rescheduling and a refund for cancellation, but not everyone has the luxury of having a flexible work schedule and accommodating family/friends that can allow them to leave a different day than originally planned or even worse, get back home. I can see how many people, if they landed in the same cancelled train situations that I found myself in, could have trouble getting back home and get to their jobs. In these situations, alternate travel accommodations should be provided. My last complaint is the lack of available staff on the train. When passengers had concerns and questions, it was difficult to find staff to help. All passengers were left unattended and allowed to wander while everyone's luggage sat out. Passengers could climb onto the train and in whatever room or seat without supervision to prevent them from taking someone else's spot. Unfortunately, I do not see myself considering taking Amtrak again and will not be recommending it to those I know. The only people I can recommend it to would be to people who have no schedule to keep, no valuables to protect, and no qualms with uncomfortable train station seating."

375,trustpilot.com,"My recent Amtrak trip.This experience could be improved by avoiding Amtrak all together. My experience was planned as a bucket list type event. I spent a lot of money for sleeper car travel. Wifi access was advertised. I rode 4 different trains. There is no Wifi. Corporate Amtrak's lack of corporate awareness for truthfulness and customer service needs is the problem. They simply don't seem to give a flying Frito about even minimal service.The initial roomette trip was uneventful, aside from the gross smell, cramped accommodations and dire need of modernization.  There was one electrical outlet. The bathrooms often made my skin crawl. I was later to learn that coach had more access to more reliable outlets than the expensive cramped roomette. The attendant was great and the t.v. dinner was ok.The nightmare came on the return trip. I had booked this trip 2.5 months in advance. I booked a sleeper roomette  from Pittsburgh to Chicago. Two days after purchasing tickets, the roomette went out of commission. I was not notified. The change was ignored and my reservation stayed the same for 2.5 months - while the remaining rooms were filled. On the morning of my departure ""operations"" fixed things. When I arrived at the Pittsburgh station the attendant rudely barked that I was riding coach to Cleveland. She told me I booked it that way and if I had a problem - talk to the ticket clerk. Fat lot of good that did. He told me there were no other accommodations and that I just didn't know how to book reservations...next time get help from someone who knew the job. I was deeply insulted. Condescension did not improve matters. I assumed that double booking had occurred. It had not. Amtrak just didn't bother to address the problem till the last minute. As a result I was bumped into Coach from Pittsburgh to Cleveland and made to believe it was my problem.  At 3:00 a.m.,on a cold winter morning, I had to gather my belongings and walk to another car in which a sleeper emptied out. The one outlet in the room was so loose that I could not use my cpap. Arrival in Chicago was a relief. My only complaint with the metropolitan lounge in Chicago were the female drill sergeants at the reception desk. Manners always help. Those gals missed that class. I did not appreciate the repeated screamed reminders to display my green pass.After a 6 hour layover, I boarded my final train. By this time I was so exhausted and short of breath. My inhalers didn't help much. I rarely had the opportunity to remove my mask. There is no accommodation for Covid and my risk is significant....so a sleeper car was important at night.  When I arrived at my final destination 5 hours later, the attendant forgot to unload my cpap. I was absolutely exhausted. My insurance company will not replace this recent replacement. I face significant health issues as a direct result of Amtrak's ""service"". I have nothing but good things to say about the attendant. He could not have been more accommodating and helpful. He is not responsible for a broken system. Amtrak's deliberately negligent regard for passenger belongings assured that my cpap would be lost without constant vigilance. Unfortunately, Amtrak has no system for tracking carry on luggage that is stored in the entryway storage areas.  My only hope is the fact that I did label my baggage. In my opinion, today's Amtrak travel is abominable. I am writing this the day after return. I have spent 2 hours , at least, on the phone with customer relations. The little compensation that was offered was insulting. I have little hope of my item being returned. My guess is that it is already up for sale on craigslist."

385,trustpilot.com,"AMTRAK VACATION DOES NOT EXIST!!!!!!!!!!So for any of you who know me know that me and my twin love to travel. We usually take a vacation trip for our birthday.  Well, this year we decided to pay homage to our father and ride the rails.  We had seen ads for AMTRAK Vacation and thought ""WOW that sounds fun, relaxing and we get to see the countryside.  We had seen these amazing pictures and videos of people enjoying these luxury trains with amazing views from big picture windows, fantastic meals and great rooms.  So we booked this very expensive trip to Niagara Falls, that included a roomette, priority boarding, meals, upgraded hotel room, Stage coach from Buffalo New York to our hotel in Niagara Falls New York close to the Falls and passage on Maiden of the Mist, our most expensive trip to date.   Yeah, were we in for a rude awakening!!!!  Our first red flag  was when a couple of weeks before our trip,  my twin received an email cancelling our Stage coach from Buffalo to Niagara Falls but per their policy(should have read that fine print) we were unable to cancel on our side.  It went downhill from there.  We got to Union Station and were going to check our bags but we weren't able to because we wouldn't get them back until we reached Buffalo.  Of course, we would need our clothes and toiletries for the ""luxury train"" that we would board in Chicago after our coach ride from Kansas, where we had an 8 hour layover, second red flag.   We thought it was worth the layover because we would be boarding our ""luxury train"" with our roomette.  Well, as you can tell from the pictures below it was a toilet closet.  Yep, that brown in the corner is a toilet and above that a sink that pulls out the wall.  They are also the steps up to the bunk that comes down from the ceiling.  For clarification on the pictures, I was standing outside the room, you can't stand when the bed is down, the blue curtains are part of the door, yep the ones touching the front of the bunk.  Oh and the straps, are to secure yourself up there so you don't fall off during the bumpy ride...no sleep for the weary travelers.  So I slept and sit beside a toilet the whole ride.  As you can also see in the pictures the train is old(probably in style when my Dad was a conductor and he died when we were fours months old)and it smelled like urine from previous passengers.  It was laughable!!! but certainly not funny.  Of course, we didn't use it...we trekked 2 to 5  cars over to use the restrooms in coach.  There was 1 folks yep I said 1 tiny shower stall for all the passengers(at least 12 rooms-double occupancy equals 24 folks)on the sleeping train to use and it was unaccessible.  We were unable to have a meal because the food was contaminated due to all the rain that was pouring into the train.  Our luggage also had to fit in the toilet closet with us.  There were no great vistas, you use the same rails as the freight trains and they have priority.  So you will find yourself stopped on the rails for hours.  Now after hauling luggage on and off of trains we finally get to our hotel(that we couldn't check in for more than 2 hours) we go to our upgraded double room and there's one double bed(after no sleep on the train)for two grown women to share and a view of the lumber yard across the street where we had to pay additional funds for incidentals.  Fortunately, we had ants(lots of ants) in our room so the hotel upgraded our room where we had a view of Canada, the nightly fireworks display and two double beds.  We were so tired we lost our first day in Niagara Falls.  We upgraded our tickets for Maiden of the Mist  to a tour of Niagara Falls well worth the extra money than stumbling around Niagara Falls with no idea of where to go, what to do, and how to get there.  Finally our last day I go downstairs to get coffee and realize that we have to check out of our room by 11 am and our train doesn't leave until shortly after midnight. So we either pay for another night or we schelp our luggage around for 13 hours or sit in a train station that long with our luggage. While dealing with the front desk at our hotel we are made aware that our accomodations and activities were booked through Price Line, while Amtrak paid Price Line 1/4th to 1/2 of what they charged us.All this to say AMTRAK VACATION is a hoax, scam or whatever you want to call it along those lines. If you're thinking AMTRAK then just DON'T!!!!!  Just fly and book through Price Line yourself.Niagara Falls is Amazing and an almost spiritual experience."
386,trustpilot.com,"… Mind you I haven’t taken a trip with Amtrack in about 16 years my mom probably 10 years…Back then we had viewing cars and the trains were clean the food was great. It Was a wonderful experience! We had fresh cooked food with the chefs that cooked our meals, There was waitresses and waiters…we had real silverware glasses etc. it felt just like a Restaurant on wheels ..fancy though! The rooms were very clean the windows on the trains were clean it looks like the advertisement they show now! 😳However mom and I decided to take a train trip to Chicago because we remember how enjoyable it was back then. After getting on the train we had a room with a restroom inside Which was not to clean and sleeping on the top bunk I smelt the exhaust from the engine which was not good. They definitely need to do some updates on the train and fixings… When getting ready to have our meals we were pretty excited,come to find out there is like five things on the menu for lunch and dinner and when you get them it is worse than a TV dinner… I don’t know who came up with this menu but the food is horrible it comes in a tin tray and It is placed on the table so when you come to eat there it is… The service that we had in the dinner car was not good at allthe people had attitudes the train conductors servers workers etc. took 4 tables nobody could eat at, I guess was their break area they did announce when they were on break… When asking to get a mixed drink we were told that you had to pay for them… When you get a room you are allowed to have one mix drink per person in that room for your dinner I actually had to show the lady what was said in the articles in order to get one… Also there is unlimited drinks however the lady who took care of the cash register and the café had an attitude and said you only get one I had to again show her my advertisement of Amtrack again and she got an attitude and said she’s gonna be talking to somebody about that! I did get sodas however… I’m sure these people are a little shorthanded but when they give attitude and mouth off at the customers and don’t clean up on the tables it definitely does not want me to come back… The food again was not good at all we finally bought a hotdog from the menu. sad thing is that was delicious compared to what we get for having a room!  …That hotdog was the best hotdog after eating all those nasty meals that I really didn’t eat too much of because you couldn’t ..they were so bad… Oatmeal was the best thing on the menu for breakfast😳 I would definitely love for the CEOs to take a train ride from Chicago  to San Antonio or San Antonio to Chicago… We very disappointing and so is my mother… The trains are dirty the windows haven’t been cleaned and I don’t know how long🤷‍♀️ I have to say the guy that took care of us in our room did a great job! I didn’t see  him much, I believe the lady in the café car had him running back-and-forth like a crazy man dropping off meals etc. the attendant in the café car also told everybody pretty much when they had their conversations at front where everybody could hear she said “these people expect us to work 24 hours a day “well I’m gonna take my break she said… and if I’m not mistaken I even had heard them say that everybody got a raise at the top except for them! talking their personal stuff in front of everybody was not good… The atmosphere was just pretty negative The food was gross The train needed updating they need to clean the windows so we could see out better they definitely need to put the viewing car back!! not having that we were so disappointed… I asked the Attendant on the train Why we are getting a heated up pretty much TV dinner and where are the chef’s  that cooks anymore? She said those are on some other trains but not this one. I don’t understand why the other trains  can have good food on theirs and this one has nasty food and no viewing car but some of the others do? I found out through the Chicago lounge personnel that they only have certain trains that have viewing cars with the homemade food where there is a chef that cooks them… If you look at the advertisements they make it look so good and you think everything is the same but it is not so if you take a train make sure you look at what you get real close and ask questions because they make it look really good… ours was not a good experience at all… The only thing I really enjoyed was the ride and talking to some of the passengers… I really hope they look into the exhaust fumes that are getting into these rooms up top that I do believe is going to be a problem one day if somebody does not take care of that it is very strong and if you have kids up top it’s not gonna be good!… The only reason this one is getting two stars is because the ride is enjoyable the view is great! I really hope someone does their homework and checks into this and see how bad Amtrack is going downhill !! I did get $300back🤷‍♀️Wow!🙄 I hope Amtrack changes!!"
387,trustpilot.com,Made a reservation with Amtrak I needed to get an extension because I am in a wheelchair and I need a room I called today to get an extension on my itinerary and I was told they could not do it and all the rooms that I booked they said they have to give them away they said the only thing they have available it's coach seating and asked if they were going to finish me Mills and they said no I also told them I needed to be by a restroom because I am in a wheelchair and they only thing they said was I'm sorry will need to put you in code seating they were rude to me and did not help answer my questions

389,trustpilot.com,"I will never step foot another Amtrak Train. Why? Where do I begin, First off leaving Chicago to The Glacier National Park in Montana was 3 hrs delayed. Once we left the Train was then 7 hrs behind schedule. I was scheduled to arrive at my Lodge in Montana at 6:30 pm. But did not arrive until 2:30am the next morning. Which made it difficult to get up at 7am for the planned Tour of the Glacier National Park included in my Amtrak Package. Every Train during my 2 day stay was delayed hrs. The Train leaving the day before my departure was delayed 12 hrs. People were sleeping in the Glacial Park Lodge for hrs waiting for their train. And the Glacier Park Lodge may be a historical Lodge but I found it to be a missable place to stay with no A/C in the room’s and no elevators. On the day of my departure the Train was on time. But once aboard many of us who had the rear sleeper car soon found out the A/C wasn’t working. The temperature in this car exceeded 100 degrees making it quite uncomfortable for many of us. The Porter in the car was dressed in Shorts and a t-shirt that’s how hot it was. The Porter at some point made an announcement saying we would all be refunded 100% of what we paid for that leg of the trip, And then later on went on and told us we would be refunded 100% of our entire trip. Which later turned out to be a lie. After making several calls to Amtrak they decided on giving me a refund of only $250 on a $4700 trip. This I found unacceptable and sent them a email telling them so which they have yet to respond to. There were other issues on my Amtrak trip which I won’t go into. But to be on a car exceeding 100 degrees on a 30+ hr trip was not only unacceptable but inhuman as well. I’m done with Amtrak. And if anyone has never rode Amtrak I hope you will think twice about doing so  after what I as well as others went through on the Train from hell."
390,trustpilot.com,"Took the auto train up and back in Florida to avoid the hassle of flying.  Arrived two hours late.  Returned 20 minutes early, then had to wait 90 minutes for my car to be off-loaded.  Paid for bedroom up and family bedroom back.  No bath room in family bedroom, at a premium price, with a bed only inches wider than the standard bedroom, and no control over the freezing room temperature.  Hindsight: flying less hassle than train."
391,trustpilot.com,"Elderly couples should be advised when booking sleepers.  Most cannot get onto the upper bunk and therefore must share the narrow lower bed -- most uncomfortable!  A Family Bedroom offers a lower bed for two that is just inches wider than the standard bedroom bed, costs a lot more, and doesn't have a private bathroom.  Older people want and need private bathrooms.  Perhaps the answer is to offer adjoining bedrooms so each partner can have a separate bed and a private bath.  If comfort and privacy has a higher price, I'd probably pay for it."
392,trustpilot.com,"I brought 4 tickets for my family from my pocket, but I am being told that each person should have their own reward system. That is not fair.  If it was not for me no one in my family would be riding because the tickets are too expensive. I have been paying for Amtrak tickets for my family, from young to old, for a very long time and did not know this was happening.  I was wondering why my points never gave back to me, but I thought it was because of the small amount Amtrak does give back.  The real reason for the lack of points was I purchased all of those tickets and was not getting credit for it.  With this knowledge I need to reevaluate my loyalty to Amtrak. Perhaps many of my family members should stay home if they can't or I will rent a car instead for our future trips. I gave two stars because the trip to our destination was great but coming back there were three delays and no communication.  All three trains were stalled. No one to talk to or explain what happen so the customers were all upset.  When they finally did attend to us everyone was at each other throat to get a seat.  This would not have happened if there was communication provided."
393,trustpilot.com,Our credit cards were stolen the day before the train so we didn't have access to funds. We don't carry cash. Amtrak personnel said in regards to it being freezing cold 🥶 that they don't give away blankets. Never have and they sell them they told us to stand between the cart when we obviously want to sleep. We spend alot of money riding these trains. I don't see why they're so tight on blankets.
394,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak used to be decent.  Been taken in from MA to VA for 30 years.  I understand mistakes and maybe schedule issues, but for somehow in williamsburg the last few times on the way down from the 9 50p to VA to the 174 5-6a to MA.  There's never a wheelchair.  The woman. On the way back is so rude.  She tried to pick a fight with me and I was not having it.  I take business class everywhere and this is not right.  I'm severely disabled so I need assistance.  On the way to williamsburg, at least they tried to help.  They brought out an office chair so I could at least rest.  The early morning woman was rude but there was a nice dude that calmed me down because I was biting that woman's head off.  I am going to file a complaint at a later time.  Other than that, I would give it higher marks.  It's just the physical pain this has caused is excruciating and unnecessary."

399,trustpilot.com,"Recently my friends and I attempted an Amtrak roundtrip from KC to San Diego. It was an extremely unpleasant experience. Not only were we unexpectedly told we were not allowed in the dining car due to CoVid (only the sleeper car passengers were) minutes after being awoken from our uncomfortable seats with an announcement telling us breakfast was served, but we weren't afforded pillows or blankets for our 2-night trip one way (no sleeper cars were even left when I booked). The train stopped after 12 hours so we could wait for the new conductor to be taxied in which took about half an hour (how they didn’t realize ahead of time they would need a replacement, I’d like to know). The train was going so slowly, a rabbit could have kept pace, and with how miserable the trip was panning out to be, at some point we gave up entirely on our destination and asked to be dropped off at the next town.  The conductor rolled right on by even as we pressed every alarm button we could find. Finally, we had to physically locate someone in the dining car who then located the conductor.  He acted cocky, smirking when we tried to explain what happened, and took no responsibility for our plight.  He brushed us off, saying we weren’t waiting in the ‘designated car’ to alight (???).  We ended up having to wait another hour to get off at the next stop and weren't even offered a taxi ride back so we had to pay for our own. Altogether, it was the worst vacation nightmare of my life so far.  I would HIGHLY warn anyone considering taking a train in the States.  Apparently, Amtrak is quite a monopoly, and poor customer service is what happens when there’s no competition.  I did give them one last chance to redeem themselves by filing for a refund request and were told that was their normal operating procedures.  My word."
400,trustpilot.com,I road the California Zephyr from Chicago to Denver and back in a sleeper room. It was dirty and the toilet did not flush. The thin sheets would not stay on the dirty mattress. There was no service at all except meals. Every train ran late.  I am very disappointed with this bucket-list experience.
401,trustpilot.com,"Took train numerous times before with no problems,except this time in June, left San antonio on texas eagle.  Roommett door closed and could not get it open. After yelling for someone to help finally attendant came and had to use a crowbar to open it. Could not give us another room. Told us if we had any problems in the night to ring call bell. Huh call bell did not even work. Bathroom not very clean and can't say the room was either. Sanitized? I don't think so. I watched someone leave room across hall and attendant only put in new bedding.ttip from Chicago to Rochester was fine. Train clean and everything worked well.Return trip was again horrible from Chicago to San antonio. Dirty and the electric outlet didn't work. Terrible experience this trip to NY.To make matters worse, I sent a letter to the amtrak headquarters over a month ago and have not received any response at all. I paid almost $5000.00 for two of us. What a waste of money. On a positive note, the attendants were very nice and tried to help."

Greyhound provided invalid departure information and several canceled buses, which made me lose two days with my loved one.  I was stranded at Greyhound's filthy Chicago terminal after they canceled my connecting bus, I would have had to wait at that disgusting terminal until the next morning.  Luckily, I thought to call Amtrak.  I was able to go to their clean Chicago terminal, purchase a ticket, and leave the same day.  The staff was very professional, the train was clean, and the train ride was great!  Amtrak saved the day and salvaged time with my loved one.  I truly appreciate the service that I received from Amtrak and will definitely plan travel again."

409,trustpilot.com,"Would not recommend taking the Amtrak. Delays after delays after delays. We took the train from Newton Kansas to Chicago and it took almost 17 hours. Suppose to be 12!! The train is extremely dirty too.We didn’t pack as much food bc we thought it was only going to be 12 hours (most of that being in the middle of the night asleep..). Do not expect much from the “cafe” and I would recommended packing your own meals. The food is overpriced for the very processed, low quality food. We aren’t even taking the train on our way back because of how disappointed we were with our time on Amtrak. We will never be taking Amtrak again."
410,trustpilot.com,"I’m a young (22yo) woman and I was traveling home alone from VA to CT. I sat in the cafe car to get some work done, and I have a suitcase and a big bag with me. When I sat here, a conductor just told me I have to keep my bag out of the aisle, so I put my hard suitcase in the corner of the bench opposite me and my big bag next to me on my bench (there are no overhead storage shelves in the cafe car). A couple hours into the trip, a man comes and asks if anyone is sitting across from me. I said no, and that he could adjust my suitcase however he needed. There’s 75% of the bench still available for him. He looked at me like I was an idiot and said “can’t you put it under the table?” And I said I didn’t think it would fit under the table, and I was looking around for another solution when another Amtrak conductor came over and said “ma’am you’re blocking the seat.” I said “I know, I was told to keep my bags out of the aisle but I don’t know where else to put it” and he said, again, “well you’re blocking a seat”. I said “where would you like me to put my bag?” and he basically laughed, looked around, had no suggestions and just again said he didn’t know but I’m blocking a seat and need to figure it out. I pulled my hard case suitcase into my lap against the cafe table, and the conductor says to the other man “when we get to NYC, you can have your pick of any seat on the train (:”. I’m embarrassed and I’m really upset by this interaction. I don’t know what I did so wrong for these two men to look at me and treat me so condescendingly, like I was being difficult when all i asked was “where would you like me to put my bag?”. The whole car definitely heard and now I feel uncomfortable and awkward and I’m so upset that the conductor treated me like that, and coddled this grown, 60-something year old man as if I was being such an inconvenience for his life. Just tell me a place I can put my bag, I’m not intentionally blocking a seat!! I’m not trying to be difficult, I was trying to remedy the situation and the amtrak conductor absolutely treated me like I was an idiot causing this middle aged man such an inconvenience."

412,trustpilot.com,"Took the texas eagle from Chicago to Texas. They had us packed like sardines. No lounge, observation car or cafe. There was a diner we could order food from but weren't allowed to sit in the diner and eat. It was reserved only for sleeper cars. We had to take the food back to our cramped seats. When ordering food, there was a line of 20 people are more. From 5pm-8pm we weren't able to get any food as it was reserved for sleeper cars only. Alot of us were on the train for 24 hours cramped together, with no way of sleeping. We also have to stop alot to let freight trains through so always late.What was really irritating was the train was finally becoming less cramped but when we stopped in st Louis they removed a coach car and cramped everyone on the train again. A woman sitting behind me has a terrible cough and claims she doesn't have covid. The staff was informed of this and she was not made to wear a mask or anything. This is not the time to be cramping the train. I used to ride amtrak all the time and loved it. It seems they increased the cost and took away all the amenities that made the train fun. This will be my last trip on amtrak as they decided to reduce the quality of the ride but increased the cost. Very disappointing."

I got stuck in Coach or I would have been stranded in Michigan, and had a loud, noisy, foot traffic filled ride that reeked of an amalgam of food smells from the cafe car, with little to no wifi service. Boo, Amtrak. I'm so done with you! I don't care to even book anything ever again with my 90,000 plus Member Rewards points. You lost two loyal customers in me and my husband  because you clearly don't care about your Members. What an insult!  I don't care what they said to me to try to convince me I was getting the same amenities as Business Class (and we all knows that's b.s), Coach is never the same as Business Class. I needed the quiet and the wifi of Business Class and instead I got a carnival of noise and smells with a constant parade of people walking up and down the aisle and into and out of the Cafe car! Not the same as Business Class at all. Next time, Amtrak will not be part of our travel plans."

416,trustpilot.com,DO NOT RIDE AMTRAK. THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO KEEP THEIR CUSTOMERS HAPPY. THEY ACT LIKE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING BUT THEY REALLY DONT.

WHEN WE CAME ON THE TRAIN WE WERE FORCED TO SIT APART THEN WHEN OTHER PEOPLE LEFT WE MOVED TO THEIR SEATS SO THAT WE CAN BE TOGETHER AND THEY SENT US BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL SEATS SO THAT THE NEXT GROUP OF PEOPLE CAN SIT TOGETHER.

417,trustpilot.com,"Update 9/21/22: I gave them a second chance. The tickets were booked 1+ months ahead of time as well. They were booked to a different destination using different trains than my previous experience. In the end, they canceled the trip again. They did not personally communicate this to me, did not offer alternatives, and did not offer a refund for their incompentence or for my inconvience. I had to contact them to receive a partial refund. THIS IS A SCAM. Why offer a service you cannot commit to? There are so many problems they need to fix! Their company prioritized upgrading luxury trains over functional equipment, more manpower, fair labor, and reliable accessibility. What a joke. So I cannot leave anything good to say about a company that has never serviced me beyond booking tickets. They'll never see my patronage again. (Stars updated from 2 stars to 1 star)Original: I am a first-time customer. Before I share my negative experience, I want to share the pro's first. It was easy to book and pay for a trip. The payment and refund confirmation emails are quick. The website formatted design and its UI interaction is well made. It's easy to navigate, accessibility provided to frequently visited pages placed on the bottom of the page. Information regarding the experience of the trip and their rewards system is mostly clear. Prices listed are what you charged; there are no hidden fees and full transparency in prices for various accommodations.My personal experience and rant:Now I attribute this experience to a set of unusual circumstances that could have been handled better. Hence, with website and mobile accessibility (through its app) and ease of booking, I have granted it a two-star review instead of one.I had booked a train to NY three weeks prior. There was a recent notification of a service disruption at Albany, NY posted on its social media and website. The notification came a few hours before my departure. An email was sent which had said, ""Don't worry, we've already set up alternate transportation for some or all of your route, and there's nothing you need to do."" I had reasons to worry; I lived 90 minutes away from the departure station and if I was denied service, then I would have wasted 3 hours and nearly half a gas tank. No further communication on said ""alternate transportation"" were given 2 hours later, either by website, social media, email, or phone call. I have been frantically checking for updates by such means as my departure time was approaching. My reserved tickets had disappeared, no longer listed, with my account on their website. The train status became listed as ""unavailable,"" which was listed as ""canceled"" prior. Having given up, I went to sleep. An update was provided on the website when I woke up. Alternate transportation, by means of a bus, was available for the train route, but no actual/credible information in whether my reserved trip was officially canceled or on-going. I called up and finally got in touch with a reservation agent. They did not acknowledge the service disruption nor any alternate transportation, things that were posted on the website. They had offered to modify the trip, but with no available seats on the upcoming 2 days on a time-sensitive trip, I requested a refund instead. Note: these are self-services offered to customers on their website. No advantages are given in calling their phone support other than ease of accessibility.I understand that the logistical communication of running a national transportation would be difficult, but not providing credible reassurance to its customers, lack of communication to its staff, and lack of consideration for time in the travel industry are reasons why I would not consider booking with Amtrak for quite some time.TLDR: My experience was bad. However, I believe that your current/prospective experience would be better based on the pro's I've seen so far from Amtrak."

The bathrooms are disgusting because they don't keep up with the cleaning well enough and there was a horrendous smell of burning plastic, and what not,which who knows what that does to anyone's health."

420,trustpilot.com,I was trying to purchase a business class ticket and they said they were sold out. I purchased a coach ticket. When I was ready to board they said it would be standing only!!! I asked again if I could upgrade because somehow my friend GOT a business class ticket. They said they were completely full. Due to COVID i refused to be on a standing only train. I found another way home. I called my friend to see how crowded the business class had been and she said it was empty and she had an empty seat next to her the whole trip. My mother travels business regularly and it is always empty. I dont know what AMTRACK is up to but I believe they have some sort of scam going! They are also promising covid safety and packing people in like sardines! They need to cough up.my money.
421,trustpilot.com,"It was not a good first experience. I boarded the train and immediately noticed how filthy it was. Food containers and wrappers thrown all over the floor. The bathrooms were barely a step above portapoties… there was toilet paper and hopefully water all over the floor. I purchased a business class ticket and the seats were very nice, the chairs were able to recline. The staff was extremely nice as well. Preboarding the train I overheard a worker at Union Station say that there was a freight train broken down on the tracks. This being my first time I didn’t think anything of it and boarded. About 30 minutes into the ride, about 5 minutes out of Oregon City we were stopped for over 2 hours… The thing that irritates me is that they knew about the train breaking down ahead of time and didn’t give us a warning while we boarded. I could’ve made other arrangements and gotten to my destination on time. They had one super nice conductor on the train and I felt so bad for her because she had to go up and down the cars all night and deal with people frustrated with the delay. Needless to say, this was my first time riding Amtrak and will be the last. Too bad because it can be so much better!"
422,trustpilot.com,I bought two tickets for my son and I.  We were traveling 3 hours from San Diego to L.A. Even though we bought seats we were made to stand.  I am very hesitant to ever buy a ticket on Amtrak again if I am not actually guaranteed a seat.
423,trustpilot.com,"Tried for hours to book a ride from Klamath falls to Modesto CA.The Amtrak app kept failing to book the ticket returning with some bs error. I instead called and sat in the phone for nearly 40 minutes to book my ticket. The person on the phone claimed the ticket was $137 and when I tried to explain that the official amtrak app claimed that the ticket was $97 and I would use that except that the app kept failing on checkout she didn't care. I was forced to pay the outrageous price.The train was scheduled to depart at 10:08 pm, bus connection in Sacramento to Stockton, layover in Stockton before final train that was supposed to arrive in Modesto at 9:54I caught a ride to the train station (half hour drive) and waited around for the train. Until I got a automated message from Amtrak, the train was delayed an hour. I decided to wait around for the delayed departure but after a while I got another message saying the train was delayed another hour and a half. I decided to get a ride back to the house to get a little sleep. I set my alarm for 12:30 to give me time to get to the train for the new departure.When I got up at 12:30 to get ready to go I found I had another message delaying the train further. I set my alarm again. Got up again to find that the train had been further delayed . This happened 2 more times untill I finally left for the train station at 3:45am the train was scheduled to arrive at 4:15 but it got delayed again and didn't arrive untill 4:40At this point we were departing almost 7 hours late and I had been up all night constantly getting up and down without any sleep due to the incremental delays.Of course the train was filled to capacity. So there was no sleeping on the trip.The train was further delayed every step of the trip and we arived in Sacramento even later than our updated time and our bus had already left for Stockton 45 minutes before we got there and our new bus was delayed an hour and a half..I ended up booking a Uber to pick me up from the Sacramento station and drive me home which cost me another $120. If I had taken the chartered bus to Stockton and the train the rest of the way home I would have never made it to a client meeting that evening. (Arriving in Modesto 10 hours late!)Giant waste of time and money I can make the drive between Klamath and home in under 6 hours and it costs me less than $70 in fuel.Instead I spent $255 and wasted about 18 hours I should have just drove."
424,trustpilot.com,"My first trip with Amtrak was absolute hell. I took the amtrak from Kansas City, MO, to San Jose, CA. First train was 4 hours late, then because that train was late, we had to wait 4 hours for the next one then there was only a connecting bus available to get us to our destination, which was a 6-hr, extremely crammed bus in which we got to our destination at 4:30am. We were supposed to arrive the day before. There are very ghetto, rude people who attend Amtrak as well. Also, some of the staff are extremely rude. My second trip to come back to my hometown, one of the staff members loudly woke up a sleeping women to move her crap so someone at the next stop could possibly sit with her. He woke me and many others up. He then proceeded to make lots of noise for over 10min, getting ready to nap right behind me. My first trip, a verbal fight between two girls and the conductor happened, because apparently one women (who was drunk) tried to offer alcohol to the other womens kid. THEN, she played victim. Seats are also not comfortable overnight and I could not sleep for the life of me. And if u plan on sleeping while leaning on the side of the bus, don’t. The train will jerk you back and fourth, banging you against the side. Do not recommend riding Amtrak. Get a plane ticket."
425,trustpilot.com,"Took the Piedmont Raleigh to Charlotte. Left on time, smooth ride. Tickets cost less than gas and you can relax better than driving. Only downside: noisy passengers talking aloud on Bluetooth devices like they were in their own space. I recommend bringing ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones."
426,trustpilot.com,"If there were less stars I would rate it at that. We have travelled by car, airplane, and cruises, so we were excited to try out the train.  Our start point was in Provo Utah at what is a booth with some seats in it. There is No Restroom, no ticket service, no one there, a gross pay phone (not sure it works) and that is it. We were ready for our 4:35 boarding on 7/5/2022, but there was no train for 2 more hours.  Okay, we know issues come up when traveling.  When the train arrived I had to wait while one of the train employees kicked a man and his service dog off the train, no idea why, so I can't really judge that, but it was still surprising, especially since there is nothing at that stop.  After getting on the train, with no instruction for riding safely, we settled down only to hear the person on the speaker talk to us in an extremely rude fashion.  Only a couple of the employees were pleasant, but we were excited and tried to get along.  The observation car is really nice, but they do not keep the windows clean.  The restrooms were so upsetting. They were very unclean and we never saw them attended to.  My husband was never able to connect to the wifi on his laptop. The train had to stop multiple times, with no explanation to us, nor were we allowed off, and we crawled along at 5 miles per hour so, so much that our train was 5 hours behind by the time we reached Chicago.  I think part of the issue may have been caused because the train was so behind they hauled at high speed during the night to make up time and that caused some engine issues and was scary the way that speed felt in our seats. They hit a vehicle at some point, no injuries, but knocked out the electrical system som. It truly felt like were treated like prisoners on this train. We were not allowed off the train, except a couple of times for a couple of minutes, no exaggeration! This was the California Zephyr experience and I gave them the benefit of the doubt, until we took it back and the only difference was the man on the speaker this time was fun and informational. Other staff really need to find new jobs, they are not people friendly. The New Orleans train was so much better, friendly people, they cleaned the restrooms, and ran on time.  I felt traumatized by the CA Zephyr.  I had bruises from being thrown around, and my elderly father sliced his arm on something while trying to walk the isles.  There is too much to add, but my final nightmarish experience was getting back to the Provo Utah train stop on 7/13, we were supposed to be back at 9:26 p.m. and we did not get back until after 2 a.m. There were 3 ladies who were at that stop as well, one elderly lady, one with a prosthetic leg and one middle age helping them. They let them off the train and without any care at all for their well being at this bench stop, told them to call a taxi, I informed the train employee there were no taxis here and he said ""that's what happens when Uber comes to town"". I let him know we have never had taxis here. My  point here is they do not care about people in the least, not at all. Also, if you think having a sleeper car will make your trip better, guess again, these ladies had a sleeper car and they had a very loud noise the whole time in their car it was so loud they couldn't sleep and didn't feel well, but the train employees would not investigate, or do anything about it. They were able to use the dining car, because they had sleepers, which was so frustrating since I had been excited to dine in the dining car and when on board was informed it was only for sleeper cars, even if you wanted to pay for your meal, anyway these ladies told me they were also treated rudely by the staff in the dining car.  I won't even tell the story about how rude I was treated in the pitiful cafe.  This train needs to be completely overhauled, updated, have hand rails installed, maybe add some trains for scheduling help, and some of the crew need to replaced.  I highly suggest Amtrak do some undercover investigating on their trains and fix serious issues. We will never ride with Amtrak ever again! I will not recommend it to anyone I speak with either.  It was very disheartening for our first train trip."
427,trustpilot.com,"It started out rocky because the train was late and then our roomettes were changed so we were then in different cars which meant different dining times and the staff seemed aggravated or unsure about helping us be able to dine together. We also were unclear who our attendant was so that made it difficult to get help when needed. Then the train was delayed a total of six hours when all was said and done and walking around Denver at 7pm would have been much more ideal than waking around there at 1am. However, the train being late is just #trainlife and you have to expect it. And the staff warmed up once we got on our way. In fact most of the staff was very kind as well as helpful and with a good sense of humor. When you are going to see someone for the next 24 hours in a small box you hope they have a sense of humor. And we didn’t have to ask to dine together for the next reserved meal- they just made it happen and I appreciated that. The food was also pretty tasty and I am so glad we had a roomette and so a place to sleep during the night, although coach seating did not look as uncomfortable as I had expected. If I were to be on the train for 24 hours again I would get a bigger room - the roomettes are really great for one but a little tight for two. Overall it was a fun experience and I enjoyed the observation car but had great views from the roomette as well."
428,trustpilot.com,"Bought rails passes, $5k in folding bicycles, $$ deposits in car rentals, hotels and planned an epic 3 wk vacation cross country.  Loaded the app. Got my thicket for the lst leg to Chicago and then tried to add the rest of my family.  Told to ""call for children""...apparently could only get tickets through a live agent.  Good enough.  On hold 1hr, get disconnected.  Call back...request a call back and call back and wait on hold.  After 45 min on hold, I get my call back.  Ask to add my family.  Told me all trains to Chicago were full!  I asked for help from Audrey the Reservation lady to try to resolve, she transferred me to Customer Relations, where I remainded on hold for 1hr 29min, until I got a recording that, Customer Relations is now closed at 8pm to call back at 8 am and just hangs up. So now I have a ticket I can't use and can't get my family added, so I did cancel it.  Called back reservations to try to set maybe another day to start our trip...and after waiting 1hr 8mins I finally get Leah that says there is a ""problem"".  That our rail passes are only good for 120 days from purchase and will expire in 5 days.  I told her that even on her website it says that they are, ""good for 30 after your first segment"".  She says that is not what it means?!?!  She again tells me to deal with customer relations in the morning.  I told her I don't think I can get anyone one the phone and even if they did something, I can't spend 5 hrs just trying to get tickets for my family. She apologized telling me they were not ""running at capacity"". So I told her to just issue a refund.  She told me there would be a fee.  I told her right on your website it says a full refund will be granted within 120 days.  She says...let me research.  Comes back and says because I book my (cancelled) thicket it could not be a full refund.  I told her I booked nothing!!!!  That is why I was calling her...TOO TRY TO GET MY TICKETS BOOKED!  She said Customer Relations was the only one that could override the fee!  The $100 fee is well worth me and my kids never having anything to do with Amtrak. EVER.  Way to ruin a family summer vacation, cost me thousands in money and planning time and give my family the biggest disappointment ever to what was going to be an epic trip."

442,trustpilot.com,"My experience that I’m writing about is the first time I brought my dog. She is 10lbs and I paid for a ticket to bring her. She was in a carrier which are the rules. She was never out of the carrier. At times, her head was popping out for a little air. She never barked or annoyed anyone on the train, in fact I was sitting in the quiet car. A conductor came over on 3 different times to rudely tell me to put her head down into the carrier. I did while petting her to ease her anxiety. He then brought a huge woman conductor over to scream at me to tell me that I would be thrown off the train if my dogs head appeared out of the carrier. I express to her that she was being rude to me and she said next stop she was throwing me off the train and calling the police. I’m 57 years old and needed to get to my destination for a family emergency. This was disgraceful! The Amtrak police came into the car and escorted me out. They were actually extremely nice and respectful. They tried to get me on the next train and the conductor told them I needed a ticket and her train was full. As it passed by, it was clear that it wasn’t. The police then took me down to the ticket counter and the nice gentleman gave me a ticket. A normal  5hour trip took 8. These conductors should not be dealing with the public. They were rude and disrespectful. I am a small woman and my dog was 10lbs. The fact that they felt they needed to bring 3 officers on to the train to escort me off, was astonishing. I would not recommend bringing your pet on Amtrak. This was one of the worst experiences I ever had. I have to say that the last conductor on the train I finally was able to get on to complete my journey, was wonderful. He was a young man and helped me put my luggage up and helped me take it down when it was time to disembark. This last conductor and the kindness of the police and ticket man are the reasons I give Amtrak 2 stars otherwise this experience would be 1 to none."

My brother accidentally purchased a metrolink ticket vs an Amtrak ticket.  We were traveling with 9 people and heading to the Angeles Baseball game.  When he was boarding, the conductor, Matt Goldman or Goodman, who was extremely unprofessional, said he could not board with that ticket.  We asked if we could use the app to purchase a ticket once we were on the train and he said that we couldn't and that he wouldn't allow it.I have purchased many tickets on the app once I boarded after, and this was the first time this ever happened.  In addition, there is no mention of being able or unable to purchase a ticket once on the train anywhere online, near a kiosk.  The conductor also got in my face up close as if he was trying to intimidate me.  He said, ""are you boarding or not?""  By the way the train was 15 minutes late already.Just don't appreciate the rude behavior of an Amtrak conductor.  I have a lot of respect for railroad employees.

It was very hot and the power went out a couple of times.  Also, the train was 4 hours late getting into Flagstaff.  On the way back Flagstaff to Chicago, the train was 7 hours late.  Yes, 7 hours!  This train's roof leaked and one of the tables in the Cafe car was rendered unusable because of it.  Power outages on this one also, and very hot on the train. I had a two day unwanted stay in Chicago because of missing my connection where I was put up in a very nice hotel, but no meals were included and I had not budgeted for that.  Also, I was sick.  It was 92 degrees at midnight in Chicago.  For awhile there, in my fevered dreams, I had it confused with hell.  When the two days were over and it was finally time to catch the train, I had Coach accommodations, though I had paid for a sleeping car.

There was a freight train breakdown which caused it to originally be late, which is understandable, but the more we continue the further and further we fall behind. If a train is late, you would think the conductor would try his best to make up time, not lose more. And this caused me to miss my connecting train in Chicago"
463,trustpilot.com,Beware handicap people. I’m a 100 % disabled vet leg braces and cane. Can not bend leg as might lead to blood clots. On line to get ticked went through all the disabled loops. Ticke says disabled on it. Conductor denied me sitting in handicap regardless of the fact they were all vacant. Now suffering in coach sitting sideways totally uncomfortable. In addition train was over 6 hours late. Terrible experiences
464,trustpilot.com,"I'm never using this service again, even if it's my last possible option. My ride from Chicago to Upstate NY that was supposed to depart at 9:30 PM left at 2:30 AM due to 2 ""mechanical issues."" How the hell does it take that long to fix things like that? Little to no accomodations or updates regarding the trip and staff were rude for no reason. We had numerous unexplained stops in the middle of nowehere and hung around stations for longer than needed. A trip that was supposed to be 13 hours, which is long for most people, was 24+ hours of nonstop annoyance and anxiety.Never, if you really care for your wellbeing, take Amtrak for any sort of trip. Save for a plane ticket or manage to catch a bus or drive. Anything but Amtrak. I'm going to fight for a refund on this trip."
465,trustpilot.com,"I had the worse traveling experience ever on Amtrak from June 1, 2022. I boarded the Silver Star 91 train at Newark, NJ heading to Kissimmee, Fl.  Before I boarded the train, the conductor told me to sit in seat 48. There was a white woman on her way to Miami in one of the seats. when I informed her that the conductor told me to sit next to her she moved into another seat until the conductor caught her in the new seat and told her she had to return next to me. According to the same white woman she was supposed to be in seat 27 but was seated in the wrong seat when I boarded the train because some person who doesn't understand English was in her seat. she said she decided to sit in the spot where I met her because she didn't want to get into an altercation with the non-English speaking man. She kept condemning this passenger for not speaking English. The entire trip she was extremely dreadful. She was drinking alcohol and smoking weed. She even purposely touched my thigh without my consent to ""reassure"" me that the wild coughing she was doing wasn't because of covid. I was wearing my mask, but she wasn't and made that connection. she was playing her music loudly and was talking loud to the point of yelling on her phone. She was repeatedly punching and pinching herself. She was cursing at the conductor demanding a seat change and threatened to shoot him. I was asleep when the confrontation started and the commotion woke me up, so I was able to hear everything she said. She even used the N-word. When we got to Washington, D.C. I told the conductor about the belligerent person I was seating next to. He said he would keep an eye out for another seat for me. I was not moved nor was she removed. She was constantly back and forth between her seat during the evening, so I was able to not be bothered much and sleep some. Then in the middle of the night, she grabbed all of her luggage and left to go to another seat to sleep. I thought the conductor finally moved her, so I was slightly relieved. However, at around 2:55 am she returned with another conductor arguing about sleeping in the wrong seat. She did the whole spiel about why she moved from this seat, but the conductor didn't care because he needed those seats for the customers boarding at the next stop. She was cursing loudly at this conductor too. Once again it woke me and some of the surrounding passengers. She used the N-word a second time, but this time it seemed she was directing it to the conductor because he is Black. The entire ride she complained to me about everything wrong with this trip on Amtrak. This is my first time going to Florida and I truly regret using the Amtrak. I was planning on taking a trip cross country on Amtrak in December, but doubt I will ever ride with this company again. I had an extremely unpleasant and unsafe trip because of this woman. I was shocked that the conductor allowed her to stay on the train after making such a threat. She was threatening to shoot your employee and they did not take that seriously. Especially since this was a week after a tragic shooting that left innocent people dead. We are close in proximity and in a closed area. What if she attacked me or the other passengers? The passenger in front of her said she felt so bad for me because she heard & witnessed everything. Even suggested that maybe the woman should sit next to someone white like her. There's a brochure in the chair pocket talking about customer safety instructions. the first thing it says is to tell your conductor when you see something suspicious or unusual, but they already knew the situation, and the conductors did nothing. They just ignored her. I dont want to believe that this behavior was tolerated because she is a white woman, but it's hard not to think that when such behavior is dismissed and other Black passengers have been kicked off for less. On top of that, the train was 3+ hours delayed. When I contacted Amtrak about my ride they gave a dismissive response about telling the conductors, but the conductor was told AND the irate passenger got into it with FOUR conductors about her behavior! This was terrible customer service and an inadequate response to something like this. This isn't my 1st time on the Amtrak, and there have been other off-putting experiences, but this is certainly the worst. I'll stick to flying. This was ridiculous."

On another occasion, when checking on the status of a delayed train, only departure info was provided on the automated customer service text line! Amtrak is sitting on a goldmine, especially with gasoline prices as they are!  Their app sucks!  They should whip up their site to make it user-friendly and up-to-date!

Like that's an excuse! Worst thing that happened after train to Chicago from Sacramento was 4 hours late, an Amtrak agent told us our luggage had already been transferred from baggage claim to train to Ann Arbor which was about to leave. So we got on that train and it pulled out immediately, That's when we discovered our luggage was not on it!  Spent HOURS trying to contact a human being at Amtrak with no luck.  Next day, we had to drive 5 hours back to Chicago from eastern Michigan to get our luggage.  Never again.  The food, however, was delicious.  That's the only reason it gets 2 stars instead of only one."
471,trustpilot.com,"If this app. Would let me leave negative stars I would. This is the first and last time we will ever take a train again. The lack of communication,  hustle, and compassion. There is so much more but I won't cuss on here. I'm fuming. Instead of making all the excuse, say sorry and explain.  Riding from Chicago to Seattle. First we were  sent to the wrong car. After getting a good seat and getting comfortable for the long ride. They said we are in the wrong car and had to move. To seats that faced backwards. Down stairs by the smelly bathroom that was not working properly.  As I now feel sick. On a over booked train. Air turned off cause one person that didn't even stay in her seat said it was to cold. Making the rest of us to suffer. While she then went to sit in the lounge car. Where its even colder.  After a day they moved us to a spot up stairs. Finally.  Well I wake up from at the most a two hours sleep to a stainge man sitting in my husband's spot. I saw how that movie ended. 😬 Then the train braking down twice. Witch cause a two hour behind schedule. Then again had to stop right before spokane. The staff was at 12 hour on shift. I get it. It was 12 hours for them. But to sit on tracks for over a hour again. This time waiting for new staff. We were only 20 min from spokane.😪 Now at a 3 hour delay.  Witch at that time we were getting a room. The guy that was in the room before us had to let himself off the train. I had to bug people for a hour to get the room clean.  I got a quick ""sorry, not my fault!"" Followed by a ""I just woke up!""  Witch of course set my mood. Its now I feel  her attitude towards me. I wanted to reply ""Well thats good cause I haven't slept!"" As I said ""this will be the last time we take the train!"" It was a waste of  days when we  could have just flown. We thought it would be a good experience.  Well weren't we wrong."

If your thinking about traveling in a sleeper car, forget it. Fly instead. I took a trip from Sacramento to Washington. Thought it would be nice for the kids and myself. Yuk. Why doesn’t Amtrak get it together and provide nice transportation?! My father came to see me in from Washington. He got a sinus infection from the train, it’s that filthy. I called to cancel. They outsource the customer service calls. I had to call back because the first one couldn’t speak English. The customer service rep rescheduled it instead of cancelling the return trip.Amtrak kept the money and called it a no show. It’s happened to me, and my father. I wasn’t about to take that return ticket either. I had to call again after cancelling. Amtrak, if your going to charge money equal to the airlines at least clean the trains. The seats have to be from the 80s. Very uncomfortable, even in sleeper cars they call first class. My father cannot afford to loose one hundred dollars. Especially when he’s a senior living on a fixed income. I cancelled his return. I can provide documentation of the two calls. Once is a mistake twice is a scam."

It was as loud as the rest of the train and people were using their phones on speaker mode. I should have driven my car."

My wife had work to do online and of course I didn’t have any Wi-Fi  We paid almost $300 for two tickets they should have gave us some kind of compensation or refund next time I’m just gonna fly this was my first time taking a train long distance I wanted to enjoy the scenery but I don’t know if it’s worth the suffering and the heat and humidity A 25 hour train ride became over 35 hours.

You are really at the mercy of the staff, and when you get kind staff that are willing to answer your questions, it’s great. But when you have staff that yell and roll their eyes at you when you ask about where you can store luggage, it’s miserable.

Trust me when I say, drive, fly, or walk to your destination before taking Amtrak. After missing connector, not only was I told by the transfer staff that they would wait (which they didn’t) but they were rude, disrespectful, and literally absent from the connector terminal. I was stuck on hold with Amtrak for hours and never was able to speak to a representative. All of this combined into the horror story unfolding before me waiting at the terminal for somebody, anybody to help me. Their refund policies are terrible, their customer service is horrendous, and one good lawsuit should finish off this joke of a company.

486,trustpilot.com,"To Whom It May Concern:We completed a two week Amtrak vacation on May 30.2022, leaving from Indianapolis, traveling to Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Washington D.C. and back to Chicago to Indianapolis.What was good:The hotels we were booked into were very nice and we enjoyed what we were able to do in a day in the cities we visited. The food in the dining car on the first three trains was exceptional. (though the selections were the same on all the trains that had a dining car and so, was quite repetitive.)Problems we experienced:We assumed this vacation was a group vacation and only after booking it, were we made aware that it was considered an independent vacation. The trip was not nearly as it was described. On the 6 trains we rode, there was never a shower on the floor with the roomettes. The roomettes are so small that when the bed is down, there is only a foot of space in which to stand and it was all but impossible to change clothes in that area. The upper bunk is so close to the ceiling on all but one train, that it was claustrophobic, not comfortable and difficult to get into for anyone over the age of 70. Customers should be made aware of that. My husband described it as being in a tomb.The restrooms on all the trains were not well kept and, in some cases, were dirty and had overflowing receptacles for used paper towels. That was a health hazard. Not acceptable.And a roomette with a commode in it?! If it were used, it would be like eating and sitting in a bathroom. Might be OK if a person is traveling alone, but without any privacy, it is not acceptable for those traveling with a companion or another individual.With the exception of one hotel, none of the hotels were in walking distance to the Amtrak station or to the activities that were included as part of the vacation which required hiring transportation to the hotels or tour pick up sites, to and from. We declined to use the voucher for hop on and off in Los Angeles as it would have cost $60 in transportation fees to use that voucher. Unacceptable. The Westin Bonaventure was a lovely hotel but there was nothing within walking distance except homeless people in tents. No restaurants or stores or acrivities.On three of the trains we rode, there was no dining car or observation car. We were told we would get 3 course dinners. The cafe car (which apparently replaced the dining car on those trains) provided food that was like something you might get in a highschool cafeteria. (A prepackaged brownie is not a great dessert!) The entre, heated in a plastic dish, was barely eatable. Unacceptable. The observations cars were also removed on those trains.had we known about these removals, we would not have booked on those trains.Only one of the 6 trains had WIFI. We were led to believe the trains did have WIFI. On the train from Chicago to Seattle, the Amtrak employee told me,“ I know it says there is WIFI but that really isn’t the case!)Because the trains were frequently late (over 2 hours, 4 hours in one case) we only had a day in each city, rather than the day and a half or two days which it appeared we would have.We were aware that our trip from Chicago back to Indianapolis would be via a Greyhound bus. What we were not aware of is that when we missed that bus due to our Amtrak train arriving more than 45 minutes later than scheduled into Chicago and we had to get our checked luggage (there was only an hour scheduled between the train arrival and our bus leaving. Poor scheduling, I think,) Amtrak did not want to help us and said it was Greyhounds problem! After much insisting, a supervisor was able to give us a voucher for Greyhound which, at first, was not accepted by the bus, but again, after much discussion, we finally were able to get on got a 5 hr bus ride to Indpls despite the fact that the bus did not have working seat belts. Bus 86381. Safety hazard.We have previously travelled by train in European countries and were quite pleased with our experiences. We are not so pleased with our Amtrak experience.We are anxious to hear Amtrak’s response to our “problems” with our two week vacation.We could not find anywhere to contact customer serviceHelen and Jim Welter,"
487,trustpilot.com,I got on Atlanta Ga to Houston tx. The train was a hour late pulling out Saturday May 27 it end up being 4 hours late total to New Orleans La. The stop in Anniston Alabama was so unorganized about  150 people got on they was drinking with their on liquor there was weed being smoked on the platform on break . Than today on the ride to Houston Tx the ticket agent had the nerve to tell me I couldn’t have a drink unless I payed for one from Amtrak. I was like why when yesterday was the party train and yal didn’t say nothing. The guy tells me it wasn’t this train. But last time I checked it had Amtrak on it. To top it off I had to listen to the customer behind me listen to Jazz all the way to Houston and he had no headphones. I guess they practice rules when they want to or just close they eyes to what they see when they want to see it.

Every trip I’ve lost a total of 3-5 hrs of my time because of delays. This is a major inconvenience for people with busy lives. The disregard for promptness is completely disgusting. Something needs to be done about the inaccuracy of timing being represented at the purchase of tickets.

We are still fighting with cancellations, have a very disappointed family and 2 very angry seniors!  No future discounts offered but they did generously not charge us a cancellation fee!

We then went to the food cart and asked for drinks, we were told we could not get anything due to the machine being out.  Then we over heard his say- if you are in business class, they could get drinks.  We were ALL in business Class!!  ANd they denied us.

497,trustpilot.com,"We took the California Zephyr sleeper car service from Chicago to Grand Junction, CO.  Overall, I rated this a “3” but there were some good and bad points that average out to a “3”.GOOD POINTS:  FOOD - The food service has improved significantly.  We had great food, white table cloth service, and a complimentary glass of wine with our dinner.SERVICE - A number of people on the train worked hard to provide excellent service.  I particularly want to mention “Reesey” in the dining car staff who was exceptionally good.SCENERY - The observation car is nice and the scenery in Colorado is excellent; however, there are only a limited number of seats available.BAD POINTS:CLEANLINESS - The inside of the windows in our bedroom were absolutely filthy with dark black dirt that obstructed our view.   There was no capability for cleaning them on the train so we had to do the best we could to clean them ourselves with Kleenex and water. Several other reviews have mentioned this same problem.SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS - The sleeping accommodations are very tiny and difficult to move around in and the “shower” shares the same tiny space with the toilet which makes it almost impossible to use the shower.  There is also insufficient water to take a shower.TRACK  CONDITIONS AND SLLEP – in some places, the tracks were well-maintained and the ride was relatively smooth; however, in many areas the tracks are not well-maintained and the ride was very rough.  For that reason we were not able to sleep more than about (2) hours at night.SCHEDULE - We wound up being over an hour behind schedule and there didn’t seem to be much effort to get back on schedule.WATER SUPPLY - At about halfway through the trip, the train ran out of water so that we could no longer even wash our hands.PUBLIC REST ROOMS - The public restrooms do not have flush toilets so it is like using a bad port-a-potty."

The walls were black with dirt, trash in our room, closet broken. We were in a bottom level and the attendants on both trips were non existent. Nobody checked on us once, or turned our beds down or help us put them away. Nobody took reservations for meals, changed out our trash cans. The bathrooms were horrible, full of urine snd poop in the toilets. The food was swill. Nobody offered to help with our bags and just stood and watched us struggle to get on board. I have never felt more disgusting in all my life and I paid three thousand dollars for this? The windows were so filthy, the steps and the floors were so gross. I could go on and on but it just makes me panic to rehash it. It was hells train and I’m never ever taking Amtrak again. They give ZERO cares about you."
500,trustpilot.com,"The five star because of the hospitable and kind staff. First encounter was Elizabeth (Liz) at the Orlando Sligh station. With a smile Liz did not tire of answering my questions.  I approached her three different times while I waited for my train.This was my first use of Amtrak. Liz was friendly, informative and welcoming. Then aboard the sleeper all the way to NY and back I met with the busiest, most diligent and hospitable Service Attendants ever.  Their goal, obviously was to please. My most favorite in the sleeper wereRodney, John and Preston. These guys were also outstanding in personality with a great sense of good humor, while waiting on everyone hand and foot.  The only guy serving in the pantry during all three meals going and coming (forgot his name) was also very professional and friendly.  My roomette was cozy and quaint. It had a toilet and sink with running water, so clever and useful. It had toilet  paper and soap, just like a hotel. I would have no problem traveling in a roomette again.  I love to fly, love airplanes but you can't roam around the airplane. You can't get coffee anytime you want it on the airplane. You can't walk to the diner or snack bar on an airplane.  Folks can sit at dining tables and play cards or other board games or just talk and laugh or stay in your room and read or listen to music, etc. Before you know it you've reached your destination.  What a neat way to travel.  If you have the time, take an Amtrak. I will again for sure, not squish or cramp on an airplane. My daughter ditto my remarks."

502,trustpilot.com,"My first train trip on Amtrak- travelling DC to Norfolk. While waiting in the terminal it appeared this is also a spot for homeless to nap, and finding a spot to sit was limited.  I decided to go business class, assuming better travel comfort-good news- seats are large, lots of lots room, wasn’t crowded on my trip. Bad news, there was no conductor to help with onboarding at the biz class car, but they were there at the coach cars. A fellow customer helped me with getting up steps with my bag. I used the bathroom- it was filthy- strewn with paper, urine on the floor, and even a food container on the floor from the overflowing trashcan. I don’t know what restrooms were like in coach- but this was awful. As I walked through the other cars to check things out, I question what the benefit of paying almost twice as much for business is. Im hoping that the bathroom thing was a fluke-"

506,trustpilot.com,"My family recently (4/25/2022) boarded a 4-day cross-country train (2-train segments) from DC Union Station to LA Union station. I had booked the tickets several months ago and had done extensive research as to the amount of baggage 3 pax are allowed to check and carry on. We had several 24"" sq boxes to check which is clearly allowed by Amtrak (as long as under 50lbs). Unfortunately for us, the two women working the baggage check were some of the most aggressive, unhelpful and unfriendly people I have ever dealt with. First, they complained profusely that we had boxes, although Amtrak policy allows shipping boxes. Then they, and others, complained profusely that I'd put 'Fragile' stickers on the boxes (nothing we packed was breakable - the stickers merely an attempt to encourage safe handling - which they told me wouldn't happen as the boxes would get thrown around anyway!). Only when I finally said, ""just take the stickers off the boxes!"" did they stop complaining about them - so why give us such a hard time in the first place?!  Then, when it was discovered one box was overweight, it was as if it made them happy to reject our box! We then split our belongings into multiple boxes so as to lighten, and the only other thing that made them happy was collecting all the fees for extra boxes, baggage and bike-shipping - which they accused me of trying to sneak through (?!!) WE were the ones stressing about the large amount of checked belongings and their completely unhelpful and snide attitude made the entire experience a total nightmare! These two Amtrak employees had clearly been at the job too long and really should retire. If it weren't for the TOTALLY AWESOME calm and friendly Red Cap fellow that helped us get our baggage from outside to inside (and stood by us almost to the end of the ordeal) I would have totally lost it (and I am extremely remiss that Mr. Red Cap disappeared before I could tip him)! What a horrible, stressful way to start a trip that we had been planning for months."
507,trustpilot.com,"I’m a fairly regular long distance AMTRAK rider on the Empire Builder. I enjoy the company in “first class” — the sleeper patrons. A few years ago the EB even offered a wine and cheese event between Montana and Wisconsin. But AMTRAK must depend on a government budget from year to year.  So long, wine and cheese!  Cleanliness is crucial to travelers! AMTRAK in general rates a C-  at best! The cars are old, creaky, and getting older, but to make up for it, please can you make them spotless! Especially and constantly the bathrooms and windows. After all, it’s a very pricey ride. Yesterday, we took the auto train from Florida. Because of the misguided policy decisions of our current Whit House, staffing has collapsed on this train. And quality control and supervision seems especially wanting and lazy.  What really turned me sour was the food and food service.  The famous AMTRAK steak was served not just rare but raw! There were only two people running the kitchen. Uncooked! I fear that the careening decline of AMTRAK mirrors that of our country. So sad."

On our way home, we upgraded, paid more to have LESS leg room and our seats were facing 2 other passengers!!! To make matters worse, our seats were up against the wall, so much for extra reclining. I'll ride coach anytime."

The train out of Stamford was extremely delayed-in fact it did not show up at all as I waited for 45 minutes.  I was explicitly told by the Amtrak officer at the station that the connecting train in new haven would NOT WAIT for this train to arrive-leaving me stranded overnight in New Haven which is neither a safe nor feasible option.  Amtrak was unable to fulfill its contractual obligation of the ticket that they sold me.  I had no option but to leave and pay to get a car ride back to Mass. Amtrak is refusing to issue a refund for the unused ticket."

513,trustpilot.com,"Good morning. Wanna make complain on staff in train and Washington train station of Amtrak. The serving personal rude and don’t know their job. On my way, Nyc-Washington I carried a pet. During all trip the staff on train stress me and my dog out. The person in my car complained about me carrying the dog on my hand without asking any documentation of emotional support. In the end, when I said about certification for emotional support of my dog the same person allowed me to carry the dog. The person said that if this is emotional support I was no supppsed to pay fee for the pet. By reaching Washington DC Union Station, I went to Amtrak Tickets Box to ask how I can return paid money for carrying the pet since the staff on train said I don’t have to pay for emotional support animal. I met supervisor, the Mr Banks, who in emotional, far from professional way, start scream on me about Amtrak working just with service dogs and have nothing to do with emotional support. Mr Banks, called himself supervisor  and resist to give any assistance with reaching out his farther management. I was so stressed out and confused by different information from different unprofessional staff of Amtrak. I just left in distress and called the hot line of Amtrak . The lady on the phone with hot line of Amtrak told me about Amtrak no having special policy for emotional support animal but she said I allowed to carry the pet on my lap since it’s emotional support. Also I asked to connect me to department in order to leave complain for Mr Banks. I never got the chance to reach the department because waiting on the phone line took more time than expected so I left request for call back. No one  from Amtrak never reach me to make my complain about Mr Banks in life. On my trip back to Nyc on 6:20am April 15 2022 from Washington DC I met again unqualified unprofessional rude staff of Amtrak. The lady ( unfortunately didn’t get chance to get the name since she was stressing me out and acting rude ), who met me in front of the train, ask me to close the carrying bag with the dog. For the first time on Amtrak staff asked me close the bag. On my question why she asked me to do that the lady start yell on me and advised me no to show up on her eyes and walk to the last car so she can’t see me. I hope Amtrak has the cameras with recorded sound to track such unprofessionalism of the staff and stop abuse of customer. Moreover, the website ask for release form for the pet. I haven’t been ask for such form on traiN NYC-Washington 12 April 2022. On train Washington-Nyc 15 April no one ask me the form either. But in Union Washington train station theory in tickets box ask to fill the form and was asking no in nice way to show up if my carrying bag be able to close with my dog in. It was no great experience for my 7 month puppy, 6am in the morning, carrying her in and out as a toy, in order to show up the staff of Amtrak how works specialized for up to 16 pounds dogs  bag. And I see no reason for this because no one ask anyway for the form on train itself. So why the staff of Amtrak stress out customers who paying for service in such way. I’m asking to check all possible cameras in order to confirm all provided by me information above and consider my complain seriously and provide corresponding commission or discount for paid tickets on 12/15 April 2022 for me experiencing stress caused by staff of Amtrak. I got most awful experience on train with my pet because the no clear policy for pets on Amtrak websites and regulations and lack of needed training of staff who presents company called Amtrak. Please consider my complain with fair and I’m gonna be waiting reaching me out Amtrak in order to resolve this issue."
514,trustpilot.com,"On Friday April the 8th 2022, my sister and I rode train #90 [palmetto) from Fayetteville Nc to Richmond Va. What a great ride. The staff was outstanding.  Very professional and courteous. It was my sisters first ride on amtrack. However, I rode the train #89 back from Richmond Va to Fayetteville NC today.  The entire staff was very rude and unprofessional.  Let's start from the beginning,  as I approached the train to board the conductor was rude from the start. He asked me and my husband to step back because he was trying to get people off the train. First of all,  that was not my husband.  It was a perfect stranger. We were both riding alone. I finally get on the train and he tells me I'm in seat 1A. Which at that time I went to my seat and It was taken already,so he put me in another seat. As the train was taking off he moved me once again to the seat with the gentleman he thought was my husband.  After about 10 minutes he came and moved me again to my original seat. The person I was sitting beside in my original seat smelled like octopus.  I turned and put my feet in the isle and put on a extra mask to keep from smelling octopus.  He comes by and tells me to get my feet out of the isle and sit in my seat properly.  I asked if I could please move to another seat. He put me back with the gentleman that he thought was my husband.  To make a long story short,  don't assume. Also, I needed water to take my medication because I'm a diabetic.  I went to the concession cart and was told it was closed. They said they made an announcement,  but no one in my car in business class heard the announcement.  I paid extra to be in business class and I didn't even have a tray in front of me for my laptop. Neither could I plug in my charger because the lady sitting beside me had the plug blocked with all of her belongings.  Also, the gentleman working the food cart was very rude. When I ask him if they had coke or Pepsi his response was what do you see. I said never mind just give me a coffee. Conductor did not help with luggage getting bags on or off. Stated you should only bring what you can handle. Very bad job train #89.I felt I was harrased the entire time."

Our roomette was supposed to come with a toilet. Didn't happen. We had to travel through 3 cars to the closest toilet. I upgraded our roomette to a bedroom on the return trip and it was nearly $700 more. Our train from Washington back to Lakeland was over 2 hours late. We arrived over 3 hours late back to Lakeland, FL. No apologies or compensation. Trying to sleep like was being on a constant roller-coaster ride. Plus the suffering of having to wear a mask.

518,trustpilot.com,"This review applies to Mr. Thomas in Customer Relations not Amtrak in general. Mr. Thomas I hope this message reaches you. He provided EXCEPTIONAL customer service and concern for my issue. There was a situation on train 92 on this past Friday in Cary, NC  in which a passenger inflicted self-injury which had the train stranded for over 3 hours. I was offered vouchers for future travel, but the seriousness of that situation has prevented me from wanting to travel due to no baggage checks for weapons. my father is ill in New York and it was imperative I got to my family. I had my daughter with me who experienced that traumatic scene. I did not get to my family until the following day. Mr. Thomas provided me a refund on my return trip. I missed the call back from his supervisor to boast about how amazing he is. Mr. Thomas deserves a raise. He deserves praise. I have never encountered a rep like him before with Amtrak. He is positively the best."
519,trustpilot.com,"If you don’t pay for a roomette be prepared to have nothing but a chair.  You will only be allowed to e it the train every thirteen hours which is unacceptable for my service dog to be denied going outside at a stop that we are literally stopped for 15 minutes.  Hot food and the dining car are for privileged only but the conductor sure makes enough announcements to the sleeper car passengers. Hey Amtrak you’re still conducting business with segregation practices that are outdated.  Sad I’m standing here hungry, my dog needs to go to the bathroom, and we haven’t been let out in 5 or 6 hours even though we’ve stopped 3 times.  The poor people bathroom is filthy .  My feet stuck to the floor.  The poor don’t get their bathroom cleaned.  Only the elite that spend 10 times more .  This extreme division of classes reflected in the “privilege” that comes from Amtrak really shows in the way the coach class people are treated and spoken to.  Come on Amtrak step it up.  Don’t you want to be a progressive service and hospitality provider directed at human beings instead of catering to the rich and spitting (literally all over the bathroom sink) on the peasant in coach?  Despicable!!!! I’ll never ride again"

521,trustpilot.com,"Wow how Amtrak went from being okay to the most unprofessionalism, worst, ridiculous services I have ever seen since being a regular customer traveling from New York to Tampa Florida let’s just start by their Stupidity of their Covid-19 procedures they are full of contradictions they talked about where your mask and have it on at all times people walk through the cars without their masks. Their is no social distancing. They implement these so called rules but they don’t enforce their rules is a waste of time. Was riding on the Silver Star 91 Car # 25120 going to Tampa and in the wee hours of the night 1:00am we had a man with a prosthetic leg who was drunk with another passenger carrying out like 2 clowns and no Amtrak employee was not around to stop these 2 drunken fools from being jerks. And to think the handicapped man with the prosthetic leg used his disability to get over on caring out like an idiot acting like a straight up fool.

522,trustpilot.com,"I was anticipating my first train ride to New Orleans but was totally disappointed after being the first one (in our group) on the train and the seat me and my mom had was WITHOUT a window view.  I asked the attendant to be switched so that I could look out the window and take pictures (past time favorite) but she was rude and said that the seats were accounted for.   We actually had 3 members in our group who decided to fly back instead so space was available for me to be moved. I believe if I paid to travel by train, I should have been able to view the beautiful scenery as well. I think those seats (without a view) should be for the staff. I will not recommend traveling by train unless it is one's choice for a seat without a view."

524,trustpilot.com,"I just filed a claim and I kindly ask that someone get back to me with confirmation that we'll receive some acknowledgement of the mistreatment and unnecessary hardship we experienced on Saturday February 26th, with Amtrak. And also, to reassure me that nobody else will ever go through what we did. All of the details are captured in the case file. In short, my family took the auto train from Lorton to Sanford on Saturday February 19th for our winter vacation (without incident -- it was an excellent experience). On February 26th, our return date, we were told we could not get on the train because our vehicle was too large. HOW COULD THAT BE? They took us down there. For over an hour we begged and insisted we needed to go (we have small children, and had to get home to New York). We were turned away without question, without negotiation, and without any investigation into a solution. And most importantly, without any care or compassion. They told us to go to an auto parts store up the street and have our mirrors removed from the car. That would be the only option. And to leave the lot otherwise. I begged for help.  Literally, my family was stranded in Florida. In the end, we had no choice but to drive 20 hours home to Long Island. Plane tickets weren't an option.We paid for tanks and tanks of gas and put a thousand miles on a brand new vehicle. Paid for a hotel and tolls. Paid the price of exhaustion. Please, I would like for someone to explain to me how Amtrak can bring us down to Florida and then completely strand us there. Without a plan. Without any effort to help us get home.The Customer Care Representative I spoke with, and who helped capture the situation and file the claim for me was very kind and empathetic. I appreciate her very much. That said, I do expect a call from Corporate to confirm receipt of this complaint and acknowledgement that the situation is being recognized for how terrible it is and that the individual that mistreated us and offered no help or solutions will be tended to. Trust me, you really don't want someone like that representing Amtrak.And finally, it would be the right thing for Amtrak to not only offer an apology, but to reimburse our family for all of the unexpected, last minute travel expenses we incurred driving all the way from Florida to eastern Long Island."
525,trustpilot.com,"Really, the worst customer service ever. Tons of unnecessary menu interactions on their automated line, inflexible policies, such as taking 72 hours to apply points to your account (WHY??? this is a digital transaction! I gave you the money, give me the points), refusing refunds for unapplied points, sending tickets where one leg is coach despite having paid for business class... I could go on. This is just a terribly run company with antiquated systems and customer service that reflects their monopoly on rail travel."
526,trustpilot.com,"I have to take this train to get to and from school, every train has been late by at least 45 minutes. The current train I am waiting on is already 1 hour and 30 minutes late and continues to further delay. When the trains are cancelled they don’t send a text or an email informing consumers until 12 hours after the scheduled time. Workers at the stations and on the train always have a negative attitude and have no problem being disrespectful to you or your family. When there is a problem on the train no employee takes initiative to control the problem instead they give them a warning(3 warnings until they get kicked off) however after their 3rd warning odds are they are already at their destination. Worst of all the employees nor the company takes no notice of consumer complaints and further does absolutely nothing to prevent the same or similar issue from happening."
527,trustpilot.com,"If I could give this ride a 0 rating I would. I usually have a decent experience but this train sucked. They are always running late but this train was over an hour behind. I won’t be getting home until almost 1230 when I was supposed to be arriving i at 1040. We stopped multiple times for around 20 minutes each time. There were screaming children behind me and everything for food and water is overpriced. The kids behind me keep kicking my seat. I am so dissatisfied and pissed off honestly, I spend a lot of money to have a short ride but it is never the case."
528,trustpilot.com,Every single time I ride with Amtrak there is a problem. From delays and terrible service to random cancellations. They also use marketing schemes to create a sense of urgency when buying tickets. Frequently I see “Only 1 seat left” and then the next hour that’s gone. I have no other option but to ride with them sometimes and they KNOW this is the case with many and they take advantage. No train ticket should be as expensive as they commonly are with the terrible service provided. Ridiculous.
529,trustpilot.com,"Avoid Amtrak at all costs!! I was quite enjoying my trip from Reno to Salt Lake City when the issue of our delay came up. I understand that another train derailing it's not something that could necessarily be controlled by Amtrack. But, the cause of my displeasure is not necessarily the derailment but how it was handled. First off, the intercom said that announcements would not be made until 6 a.m. unless there was an emergency. I think backtracking to Elko and having a 12-14 hour delay is cause for an emergency yet no announcement was made. I was woken by a confused call from my family that I hadn't arrived. When I asked I was told the situation first apathetically and then very defensively from the employees in charge. One employee loudly accused passengers for being ungrateful that we were still alive and raising his voice to tell calm passengers to calm down. The only option for food for coach passengers was to purchase overpriced junk food from the snack bar and a small complementary bag of cheez-its. Given the unexpected and long delay, I think the coach passengers should have been fed in the dining car even though that's not included in their ticket. Or at the very least be offered junk food complimentary more than a small bag of crackers to tide us over for hours. I and several others had people that could pick us up from Elko but we were not allowed to leave the train. I was told this was because we could not block the Elko station but we could have easily pulled up to let people out that wanted out and then go back to the train yard where we had been sitting. I was told aggressively by one of the employees that he would be fired if he let me off the train. When the buses arrived to take us to Salt Lake (8 hours after we were supposed to have arrived at Salt Lake originally), there was only one employee that was authorized to move checked bags so we waited in the buses for over an hour as one person had to personally move every bag to and from the Bus and Train. There were many passengers, including a man and his son that I met on the trip, that decided it was not worth all the delays and wanted to go back the way they had come since the train was going to be going back that way anyways. These passengers were instructed to buy an additional ticket to go back even though they would not be receiving the trip that they paid for in the first place. That is absolutely ludicrous. Not only that but we all were directed towards the customer hotline that was obviously overrun by calls given the situation. But, I had tried to call the same number the day previous before the derailment to extend my ticket to Provo. I was on hold for about 45 minutes before an employee told me to just wait until we got to Salt Lake because no one was ever going to answer. What good is a customer service hotline that everyone is directed to if no one answers even when there's not a crisis? The 45 minutes does not include the 10 minutes that I was shouting at the automated response my confirmation number which it continually got wrong. I was told by repeat customers and employees that to ride the train is to always take a risk especially recently as it sounds like the freight trains are doubling up their trains which are more likely to derail. This was my first train ride and I did not see a warning of this kind anywhere on the website. I even went back and looked and all I found was a Blog about how much better riding a train was than another kind transportation. If these kinds of delays are expected and frequent there should be warning when the ticket is purchased so that customers can make an informed choice. As someone who never rode a train I was almost ridiculed by others that I did not seem to know this. I find Amtrak understaffed, unprepared, and indifferent to the experience of their customers. I will not be repeating this experience again and I have actively been telling all in my acquaintance to avoid Amtrak at all cost. I have been waiting several days to file a complaint on the customer service hotline as I do expect it to be backed up for days given that it is obviously understaffed."

532,trustpilot.com,"I recently rode the Amtrak from Tampa to Ft Lauderdale and back (roundtrip) to go on a cruise. the ride going was ok. My beef is that on our return from our cruise which we docked at 7:00am when we get to the Amtrak station around 8:30am We find out that the station doesn’t open until 11:30am. So we were stuck outside the station for 3 hours waiting for them to open. No accessibility to bathrooms.  That is ridiculous. When you have travelers coming in especially from a cruise ship which always dock in the early morning, the stations should be opened at least by 9:00am. At the very least let the passengers know ahead of time what time the station opens. ( maybe print it on the ticket somewhere. I’m a VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER."

I was disappointed upon learning the dinning was for sleeper passengers only, I was looking forward to purchasing a nice breakfast for myself and wife we have in the past. Two frozen breakfast sandwiches nuked in a microwave for ten bucks ? Then for dinner a mad rush through the union station Denver to find something to eat? The service was lousy, was told because of covid, cutbacks in staffing necessitated the changes in service. The ride I would give 5 stars over the Rockies on the Zepher has been a dream of mine that didnt disappoint.  To the crews I get the frustration on being shorthanded, not blaming them but train cleanliness, and quality service are missing on today's Amtrak we really felt like lower class passengers."

We had to wait 2 hours for a conductor once we were suppose to leave Orlando.  I get it that conductors can only control a train so much hours, but why didn't they have this person waiting.  Once we got in West Palm we were told that we had to wait another 1 hour.  They had to turn the computer off and reboot by 12mid- I was support to arrive at my destination at 6pm I arrived at 1pm.  AMTRACK COMMUNICATION IS HORRIBLE. IF I COULD GIVE THEM A ZERO I WOULD NOT A ONE STAR"
539,trustpilot.com,"Traveling as a single mom with two kids and a service dog, I can say the staff was amazing and very kind. Travel was quiet and very pleasant. I truly appreciated how kind the staff was. We were in coach seats not in rooms but the ride was really enjoyable. The leg room is pleasant and the seats are comfortable."
540,trustpilot.com,"We booked a room from San Francisco to Seattle which was supposed to depart at 8:50 PM and get in around the same time the next day. We were delayed almost 5 hours and when I asked if we should get a hotel rather than sleep in the train station I was given non-answers and no one apparently knew where the train was or when it would be moving. When I called customer service I was told I was out of line and entitled. When we finally arrived in Seattle around midnight we had fallen asleep and woke to someone yelling outside that they needed to get the train to the rail yard. No one knew we were on the train and we had to run off and leave some of our belongings behind. I have tried contacting their customer support several times with no response. About the train itself: The roomette area smelled like sewage and we had to walk through it every time we wanted to go to the dining car or the observation deck. I was expecting airplane food and I was still somehow even more disappointed. The staff got off the train and were throwing snowballs at the windows while we were stopped yet we were told we could not de-board for fresh air.Please save your time, money and sanity and find a different way to travel. We have family and friends who were excited to hear about our trip because they had planned on taking the same one, or similar, and luckily we have been able to talk them out of it with a quick synopsis of our terrible experience."
541,trustpilot.com,"Train 48/ leaving Chicago on 1-24 at  9:30pm. Getting on, an employee said to a lady next to me ""put your mask on or I'll kick you off the train. A little too aggressive I would think. This also was the only train I have been on where they did NO announcements such as emergency exits, bathrooms and times the cafe was open etc.  Seeing we had a 12 hour ride, we went to the lounge to have a few drinks and talk. We were the only ones in the enclosed lounge along with about 5-6 employees. Immediately felt we were not wanted by the employees with looks and facial expressions to each other and us. I started a small conversation here and there with the employees as they rolled their eyes and made small comments under their breath. Such as after I asked a question and it was answered, I would hear ""anyways.... accompanied by an eye roll. Another gentleman we did not know came to sit with us, he swore once, the male employee then stood up, positioned himself infront of our table, put his hand on his walky talky and in a very deep voice said ""watch the profanity"". He then sat back down. Mind you, he was about 2 feet away from us at his table. So his approach was uncalled for and threatening. The gentleman that was sitting with us apologized and there was no more profanity. At that point, we felt attacked and targeted. So we just kept to ourselves talking. I stood up to get a drink and when I came back I told my husband the time the lounge closed. The rude employee jumped in my conversation and said ""east coast time"" as rude as can be.  My husband was now upset, he turned and said ""your real ignorant"". At that point they all stood up ABRUPTLY, said ""here we go"" and  the employee said to my husband ""the next stop is yours"" it was well known they were just instigating and waiting to abuse some power. A moment later a lady came over to us after all employees were gone, also very aggressive. Instead of asking what the issue was, she told us that we were on her nerves because we were told about profanity and they all have had very long days. My husband asked her, on camera if she was the Amtrak police and she said yes!  I'm pretty sure that's illegal to misrepresent yourself as a police officer. Some back and forth conversation and then she left.  We have had a great ride the other 30 plus hours besides this specific ride and staff. This changed my mind on future traveling. Will not ever take amtrak train again!"

543,trustpilot.com,"We were on an Amtrak vacation to the Grand Canyon on October 16,2021.  The train broke down around 8:30 am somewhere in Indiana.  I overheard an Amtrak employee say, “this engine is a piece of garbage.”  Another employee told me the train should never have left Washington, DC…we boarded in Pittsburgh.  I called twice before we left on the trip to be sure I’d have a wheelchair waiting in Union Station to make our connection.  A new engine was hooked on to our train and we finally got into Union Station five hours late where no one was waiting to help me to our connecting train.  Finally a golf cart type vehicle showed up, but we missed our connection!    Amtrak did put us in a hotel in Chicago.  I finally got through to Amtrak Vacations who told me to just go home! Because we missed our connecting train, we lost all of our hotel, tour, and transportation reservations.  We left at midnight on Saturday, October 16, and I was back in Pittsburgh on Monday night, October 18.  The whole train experience was a nightmare.  Two of our foursome were handicapped, and our rights were violated causing us to miss our whole vacation!  I have filed a claim under the ADA.  I have been fighting for four months trying to get amtrak to refund the balance that was not covered by Amtrak Vacations.  In my opinion, never take a vacation on Amtrak!"
544,trustpilot.com,"My experience with amtrak has been horrible!!! First due to inclement weather which I know they have no control over, my trip got cancelled and they turned the train back and dropped us off at the platform guy got picked up at almost 24 hours later! That's right I was on the train almost 24 hours waiting on them to figure out what in the hell they were going to do.Then I put in for my refund for my ticket which they said would take 3 to 7 days, 7 Days Rolls by and nothing from my bank about getting my refund. I called back and come to find out the customer service department associate didn't even open up the email for my request to start a case for my refund!!! That is completely and totally unacceptable and completely unprofessional. So I got a hold of a customer service representative who started the case File and said I should get it within 24 hours after the case has been opened up. Almost 3 days Rolls by and again crickets so I call back, the agent I spoke to said that I have been lied to from the get-go and it could take up to eight weeks to get my $64 back.....8.....weeks!!!!!!!I don't know what Amtrak is trying to pull but I am staying far away from them in the future and needless to say if they keep giving me the run-around I will be going to a lawyer about this and we'll be making it into a legal issue. Stay away from Amtrak!!!! Just drive yourself to your destination."
545,trustpilot.com,"A good experience. Quiet ride from Boston to Newark and again on the return trip. Only issue I have is there isn’t a lot of storage for larger luggage, but that’s more because my suitcase isn’t easily lifted onto the overhead storage. I’ve used them before, and I would use them again."
546,trustpilot.com,"Took a trip from San Diego to Los Angeles, the San Diego’s staff was nice and it was comfortable in business class. I needed help with my luggage and they offered to help me. I had to take another train from LA to El Paso, it was Coach class and is nearly the same as business there’s no big difference. Some people from the crew where rude and annoyed when asking questions…they have big windows for the views but they are dirty and they don’t clean them. The restrooms are acceptable. I am 20 traveling alone and noticed it’s kinda dangerous being on the LA station at night, there is random people and saw a man with a gun screaming. The Amtrak isn’t also completely save because obviously they don’t check the baggage in the train station. Bring something to defend yourself if someone approaches and don’t leave your baggage alone when inside the train!"
547,trustpilot.com,"My family and I had the worst traveling experience ever. We were scheduled to leave New London 01/02/2022 but our train was canceled and rescheduled to leave 01/03/2022. We were able to travel from New London to DC for a layover that turned into a very chaotic situation. We arrived in DC from New London at 5:45pm scheduled to depart 7:24 going to Savannah GA our final destination. We sat in Union Station from 6:00pm until 8:45pm then we were boarded. However the train never departed the station so we began to worry wondering what’s happening. By now it’s 01/04/2022 at 1:30am and a Conductor finally appears with a Security guard and very rudely says this train isn’t going anywhere tonight, everyone has to get off… without any explanation. This is not an easy task because my mother is 96, one sister is wheelchair bound, the other has Parkinson’s, and my brother has a severe nerve disorder so all the transferring was stressful. It takes us 20mins to get back to the station with our luggage. We spent the night at the station now it’s unsure of what to expect. Later that morning around 6:30am another very rude employee walks through Union Station yelling that no Southbound trains will be leaving the station. That meant another day of cancellations so we had to find accommodations at our own expense with no explanation or consideration from Amtrak. I had to reach out to Amtrak to initiate our return home by calling reservations and holding on the phone for 3 hours! We were finally placed on a train to leave DC on 01/05/2022 however the Conductor let it be known that our boarding was an inconvenience to him and we would have to wait until after everyone boarded before my family could be seated. My husband and I had to sit in the food car before he put us in a seat only to be humiliated when a passenger approached us and said we were in her seat. Once again we were seated in the food car until we could be reseated. It wasn’t until we began talking to other passengers that we learned bad weather caused our trip from he!! My advice to Amtrak is to require its employees to go through sensitivity training and treat paying customers with respect! Without paying customers you wouldn’t have Engineers, Conductors, Customer Service Reps, etc. Do better Amtrak cause you lost these 6 customers forever!"
548,trustpilot.com,booked +$900 trip from TX to SD....1 day later get call telling me cancelled & they have other options to present...On hold now for 1:15 & going...Tried to cancel online but they will charge 25% fee cuz I booked a sleeper....never again.....
549,trustpilot.com,"Took train from New Orleans to Chicago with my husband and two small grandchildren. Thought the grandchildren would enjoy, since they love trains so much. We had family room for four which supposed to have private bath. It had bath in hall along with about six more rooms that also used same bath. These were so dirty. Even if you used  disinfectant  wipes you would use all just on sink. The floors and toilets were.  The room we were in was horrendous. It looked as if it wasn’t cleaned in years. The closet was five inches deep and one hanger and that was for four people. The staff was great but would never ride Amtrak again. Food was horrible. Even when ordered spaghetti and meatballs for kids it was mostaccioli which noodles were hard. Train ran little more then two hours late. I would not recommend anyone take this train."
550,trustpilot.com,Once reaching my destination discovered my luagges were damage both had a missing wheel. Workers don't work for Amtrak they work because they have to. No interpersonal communication skills no accountability for me seeing the worker being aggressive handling the luggage off the train onto the truck bed. I will never again use Amtrak nor allow a person I know to ride Amtrak. I used that luagges twice brought in 2020.
551,trustpilot.com,"They lied about whether a voucher would be refundable or transeferable, and then demanded that we use it during hte middle of a pandemic instead of letting us either transfer it to someone who had to travel (we had someone we could do this with) or just giving us our money back.  Lying thieves.  Worst customer experience ever.  They were surly and mean on the phone."
552,trustpilot.com,"So train from WTN to PDX (Oregon), booking agent fails to get email correct so no e-tickets or precovid check, day of trip train arrives 2 hours 15 mins late this trip was with children so that sucked, then the arrival into PDX was almost 3 hours late and along that 24ish hour trek, there was no TP in multiple bathrooms, no sanitizing done at any point although masks are required and zero silverware or condiments in Cafe car. Employees without masks in lower levels on multiple occasions and overheard an employee talking about sleeping with the conductor last night at the stop at Spokane to another coworker. Ew, not professional...but wait it gets better. So the return trip to leave Saturday at 4:45 pm from PDX to return to WTN is canceled until Sunday due to weather, they refused to provide overnight accommodations so we get a cab and a hotel, but then we are informed that the train is now canceled until Tuesday so we get another night at the hotel...we are then informed that the train is now canceled until Thursday afternoon. All the while we are having to pay for our own hotel, food and cabs and when I call Amtrak to find out if there is any way to get a refund or discount I'm told they have to open a case and comment the issues so I get a case number through customer relations. I'm also told they cannot assess if a refund or voucher for future services will be allowed until the entire trip is complete, that at that point, when trip is complete I can then call to handle the case. Well, my husband now gets fired for not being back Monday so we cancel our tickets for the Thursday trip that would get us home Friday night, almost a week later than planned. We rent a car to drive back, in total out of pocket costs are totalling over $1,000 due to these canceled trains. Im understanding to a point about weather issues and that being out of human control but the whole experience was so messed up on so many levels. I call yesterday, which was a Sunday to deal with resolving the case and am told that customer relations is only open Mon-Fri that I must call back so I call today, Monday and am told they will not refund the tickets, mind you I'm not asking for compensation for the food, cab, hotel, car rental, just the train tickets but still get a no and that if I don't agree with the answer that I must then email corporate and wait for an email response as to whether they feel they should have to refund us. I'm so mad right now, I'm reviewing simply to inform people that if you get stuck they likely will not help you and you will be paying out of pocket for unexpected costs if you're stranded somewhere where you have no friends or family. Each time I called it was hours of waiting and when I did talk to someone I was hung up on multiple times even though I did not talk down to, curse at or be rude or talk over the agents. We experienced such unprofessional people during this trip and no one seemed to have any answers. Please be aware that their mask policy is ridiculous, you must wear one while sleeping too. We have taken this same trip probably around 15 times or so in the last 3 years and have never had such bad service or communication issues. We almost got stranded in a state 1200 miles away from our kids because they simply seemed to not care about their cargo, humans. We plan to get a lawyer, we are not standing for this."

554,trustpilot.com,"Amtrak Train Travel(Don’t waste your money)Chapter 1As a Christmas present to my wife, I decided to give her a train trip. We were to spend Christmas with my sister in Phoenix, Arizona. So instead of flying to Phoenix, we thought we would take a train to Phoenix, huge mistake. Not only did it cost more than three times the cost of an airline ticket, but it was the most grueling; stressful and trying travel experience we have ever had.It started in Memphis, Tennessee. This is where we boarded the City of New Orleans train bound for Chicago, where we were to make a connection to board the Texas Eagle bound for Phoenix. Well, the City of New Orleans train arrived two hours late. We were to depart Memphis at 9:40 pm but didn’t depart until 11:40 pm. In addition to being late, our bedroom in the sleeper car was the size of a closet. The attendants had stuffed towels between bulkheads to prevent them from rattling. Plus, another warning that I am going to clue you in on, that Amtrak never mentions is, train horn noise! Every time the train enters an intersection where the train intersect a street; road; highway, it will sound its horn for 15 seconds before entering that intersection.  So, the thought that you will be falling to sleep to the clickety-clack of the train moving down the track, is nothing more than an illusion. Now, for another illusion, the great food image aboard a train is just more “smoke & Mirrors” sold to you by Amtrak. Instead of the food promised at a lovely table, we were served microwaved food in either cardboard or plastic container, that was a step below hospital food. If you are considering a train trip, I would say “DON’T DO IT”!!"
555,trustpilot.com,"I never write reviews…. This topped it off though. I will no longer be supporting Amtrak. I was supposed to arrive at my destination by 1pm and I’m going to be getting their by 315pm. If you’re on a time crunch, DO NOT TRUST THAT YOUR TRAIN WILL BE ON TIME. There are many things that are out of their control, but nothing should get delayed for over 2 hours. That’s just dishonesty."
556,trustpilot.com,"Horrible customer service ! Cancelled my trips TWICE and would not refund my fare, would only issue a voucher, so I could come back for MORE OF THEIR HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Hours of wait time on the phone to speak to an agent, really poor website, I now know why this is such a horribly run company. Don’t bother with Amtrak unless you like being treated like dirt and frustrated endlessly. Fly instead, trust me, it’s cheaper and better."
557,trustpilot.com,If you don’t mind being scolded like you’re a three-year-old this is the form of transportation for you. I have never left a bad review on any site. Don’t expect to be treated with respect Belittling is taken to a whole new level on the Amtrak I used to love taking the train (not anymore)You’re not gonna believe this 45 minutes after I wrote this post our train hit a car. We are now stuck on a bridge watching the ambulance helicopters and fire departments coming to assist I’m hoping the people in the car are OK
558,trustpilot.com,Well Amtrack has ruined mine and my girlfriends first Christmas away from home. With more than 24 hours of delays and having to sleep on the floor of a station we have missed both of our family’s Christmas events. My first time on a train and can confidently say I will never take one again. The only star on here is because I can’t do 0.
559,trustpilot.com,I have been on a 4 day mission so far trying to get a representative on the phone to assist me with booking my auto train ticket to no avail. I spent 2 days on hold for 2 hours each day only for my call to be routed to an automated survey line.

I’ve ridden trains all over the world and Amtrak is awful, terrible customer service, long delays, nowhere near the 8 hrs quoted for the trip, took 11 with poor service even though you’re paying a lot for wine and a grilled cheese. Wifi doesn’t work and they’re simply unkind on the train. Never again"
561,trustpilot.com,"This was my first time experiencing Amtrak.I was already aware of delays being common, so I set my depart date a full day before. I hoped it wouldn't go nightmare scenario where it's cancelled without refund & I have to drive anyway, or end up stuck somehow. & I [hate] driving.Fortunately, Amtrak is not that low.I had to modify my trip, but because it was so close, I needed an agent. The automated system gave me an estimated wait time of ~1hr & provided a callback option, but I missed it. It only gives 1 opportunity to accept the callback option, & never again throughout the hold time. Seeing other reviews of the customer service line, this may have been relatively fortunate, as they stated that agents could [never] call back.So I waited...for ~3.5hrs...just to get an agent...after the automated system told me it was only a ~1hr wait.Went fairly smoothly. The agent sounded like they were dead inside, but fortunately, they were quick, polite, & weren't rude otherwise.(Continued)The first half of my trip was smooth. Got to my destination at the expected time. Seeing as this was during holidays, the trip was actually shorter than driving would have been. Coach is only slightly more expensive than the gas needed. The reduced stress is a boon & makes up the price difference. Though  considering European & Asian railways... it should be cheaper.On my way back, I was on a, possibly [the], southbound train that was caught by the winter storm on the east coast. This was Jan 3, 2021.I-95 had a super pileup of shipping trucks. So considering that, the train was still leagues better.The snowfall was heavy enough to down trees & block the tracks. We were stuck on the train for almost 24hrs. We had a moment, ~1.5hr, where the train was powered down. So no heat, while it was freezing outside. Fortunately, authorities came to order Amtrak to move us back to our starting locations.Minus 1 star to Amtrak for that, shouldn't have needed to be told.Minus 2 more stars for letting us all be cold. I'd hate to consider how much longer they'd let us steadily freeze had there not been orders from above.We all got transfers at least. No charge. Delay time was 2 days. Train cars were packed from Amtrak trying to catch up.As for blocked railways causing that delay, Amtrak doesn't maintain them. It's not within their scope.Maintaining the railways is mostly under stewardship of CSX (Chessie Seaboard Multiplier).Much like a suburban firebreak, railroads need the tree line cut back to prevent wood debris falling in the way. One prevents your house burning. The other keeps trains running without derailment or other damage & stoppage.During both my away & return trips, I noticed that, for most of the distance, the trees were 5-10 paces away. That's not acceptable.Again, this is a CSX responsibility. [Not] Amtrak.I can't give an Amtrak a minus for that.Good news, the stress was still less than driving, & I got home safe. Would ride again, if only because driving is a -50 stars in my view. Barely a compliment.I recommend airlines if anyone hates trains that much. Because even with electric vehicles, the stress itself is still cancer. Vehicle automation is also a waste of resources."
562,trustpilot.com,"Yesterday, I drove 1 hour to Roanoke to catch the 6:20 am train to Penn station. I was running late. I ran up the ramp and the train door was still open. When I got to the door the conductor put his key in the door closer and shut the door while I was standing there. I pleaded to open the door, that I just drove one hour and need to get to NY. Coldly, he shook his head no and the train started to move slowly forward. I was shocked at this callous behavior of an Amtrak employee. Years back a conductor would have been happy to help a person. Today they are stoic, angry, cold people employed by this company. Where is the humanity in people today? Karma will do it's job for this man. Amtrak... you should be ashamed at reading this account of your employees behavior."

I don't see an option to add media but I have videos of wiping a clean white towels on the upholstery surfaces and it coming away with black (not dust, BLACK) on it each time. Their cleaning regimen needs to at least include wiping *all* surfaces with disinfectant or mold control or something! Especially the places faces will be. For the price I honestly should've just flown but I thought I was getting a relaxing, scenic train experience.Food is just frozen packaged stuff they microwave."

I got the text notifications almost 12 hours AFTER the train was originally scheduled to leave. Then the app gave me the train station address which I shared to be picked up. And it was actually 1.2 miles away from where I was dropped off. All around not a great experience and will most likely just fly next time."

Not only was my first train delayed by two and a half hours, and I was on my second train for two and a half hours longer than was scheduled, but the employees are terrible. They don’t communicate anything with you at all or help you in any way. I saw countless people press their help button and not one time did an employee come to help them. This is something that i would not recommend to anyone looking to travel efficiently."

572,trustpilot.com,"My husband and I rode the California Zephyr from Chicago to San Francisco, leaving on Oct 24, 2021.  We paid a little more than $2,000 for the experience, riding in a sleeper car.  While the train ride and scenery were terrific, we were thoroughly disgusted by how filthy the cars were!  I don't know that anyone vacuumed our room and the bathroom was disgusting.  Every piece of window, mirror, glass was covered in fingerprints.  The carpets were filthy.  Even the windows in the Observation Car were disgusting.  It took a lot of fun out of an expensive ride.  Would not pay for that again.  On the bright side, our purser/car attendent was kind and helpful, and the meals in the restaurant car were good."
573,trustpilot.com,If you want to have a miserable ride then take the Amtrak. Supposed to arrive at 9 am currently sitting standstill waiting for the crew to switch because they can’t work over 12 hours. It’s currently 11 am and they haven’t made an announcement yet. All it’s been was delay delay delay. Been Sitting here for 40 minutes waiting for crew change. Long story short don’t take this it’s garbage.
574,trustpilot.com,"Took the 5 California Zephyr. The views, which have been there for a while now, are still spectacular. Everything else is a different story. My god, Amtrak is in a sad state. Got a roomette because there was no observation car. How is this possible on your most scenic route? I dont want to focus too much on the specific employees of my specific train because clearly with the reviews, it’s a management and systematic issue so consider this a review of the car attendant and not my car attendant. But here goes… My room was disgusting. I found loose pills on the floor, the seats smelled like BO, and there was nasty dust everywhere, Any kind of non upward facing flat surface was dirty. My car attendant was one of the rudest people I’ve eve had to interact with. And thats the problem, you have to interact with them. If they hate their job cause their job sucks then fine, but part of the roomette system is that you must interact with the attendant. You have to order food through them and have them take your garbage, and they come by to do “turn down” everyday. I literally was anxious about even ordering my meals because I had to interact with my car attendant. So you pay for the bed and nice rooms, but know that an additional cost, is that you’ll be more polite than the people you’re paying to be your hosts. You basically have to be rude. It’s the least professional experience I’ve ever had. I asked for a menu and he literally rolled his eyes at me. Every single meal he got wrong, always bringing me less than what I ordered. Never once came by to see if I needed anything or if the meals were wrong. I didnt even bother saying anything because it was such a chore. Forget whether or not I’m a customer and he’s in the hospitality field, he didn’t even treat me like a human. I was a pest. An annoyance. I said thank you after every interaction and he never once said you’re welcome. They act like because they call you sir, that they aren’t insulting you to your face. He just turned his back, grunted, and left. I’d literally rather pay more money to not have a car attendant at all. Im sure the job sucks, and the employees act accordingly, so just cut it and let us order our own meals and not be treated like an unwelcome intruder. I just want the views and the bed, I dont want to have to stay in someone’s house that hates me."
575,trustpilot.com,"Worse experience of my life.  My family and I were traveling from Freeport Maine to Boston for a full day. Staff on train were rude, bus showed up at station to transport us partially due to track repairs.  Then when we got to Boston I received a phone call stating the return train was CANCELLED!! The last train home would be at 5 pm (we were scheduled to leave at 10:30 pm and had non-refundable reservations for events).  I went to the train station and they did not even know that the 2 evening/night trains were canceled.  They offered to switch my train to the 5:10 on or next day.  Was told I could not get a refund but could reschedule- given the rudeness and poor service we ended up spending money to take the bus home from Boston to Portland and find a ride to Freeport. The bus was an hour faster because there were no stops, was clean and relaxing. My return train had already been rescheduled from 10:30 - 11:45 then back to 10:30 all within a few weeks.   I will never use Amtrak again, I will take my own vehicle.  Not customer service oriented."
576,trustpilot.com,"I called to make my reservation over the phone because the credit card server was down. It took like 12 minutes to complete the automated ticket purchase, which was actually relatively smooth, to give them credit. Then, at the end of the call, after I had paid and everything, the robot lady told me she was sending me to A REAL PERSON SO I COULD GIVE THEM MY EMAIL FOR THE E-TICKET. I WAITED MORE THAN 50 MINUTES ON HOLD BEFORE I HUNG UP. OH MY GOD. WHY COULDN'T THEIR AUTOMATED SYSTEM TAKE THE EMAIL?!?!! WHY WOULDN'T THEY JUST SAY TO GET THE APP?!?!?!!?!?!? I'M SO ANGRY!!!!!"
577,trustpilot.com,"So my Mother and I were going to take a train from South Bend to Phoenix.  Thought it would be a great opportunity to spend some time together and be a picturesque adventure.  Well my Mom does not like to use her card online so she calls Amtrak to purchase her ticket.  At that time she was informed that we would be on the train from South Bend to Chicago then hours later, possibly overnight,  we would take a bus from Chicago to Flagstaff and spend one or possibly two nights then take a train to I foget where then transfer to a bus to Sky Harbor.  Ah is it me or is that a bus ride not a train.  LISTEN UP AMTRAK!  GET WITH IT!  YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE STRONGER THAN EVER!  AIRLINES ARE OVERWHELMED AND SUCK.  YOU COULD GRAB THE BALL AND MAKE BILLIONS.  AND IF YOU DO REMEMBER ME WITH VOUCHERS!"
578,trustpilot.com,"Left from the Houston, TX Amtrak station and the train was 2/3 hours late. Johnny who handles ticketing, baggage, loading and mad customers did an excellent  job. He was from behind his booth working with everyone keeping us updated and what were the problems. So happy he was there otherwise this would be a 1 star review."
579,trustpilot.com,Train was supposed to arrive at 11:48 and now apparently will come at 12:22. Some next level bs.
580,trustpilot.com,"In late July, 2021, my husband and I traveled from New Orleans to Memphis and back via the City of New Orleans (train.) I brought antibacterial wipes and used them on all surfaces we would touch in our roomettes. I was shocked by the amount of actual black grime picked up by the wipes. Amtrak's claim to be ""utilizing EPA-registered cleaning products and enhancing cleaning on commonly used surfaces"" is a whole lie.Aside from this, the staff was amazing and our trip was enjoyable. I have two observations:1. If we choose to eat in the dining car instead of our roomette, we have to stagger and stumble our way through a turbulent train, gripping and touching all surfaces to steady ourselves from car to car. Given that we are still in a pandemic, it would be prudent to include single-use antibacterial hand wipes.2. By design and name, it is expected that passengers in the sightseer lounges are watching the scenery.  I understand staffing and resources are constant issues across all industries. However, all of the windows on our observation car were visibly filthy, hindering our enjoyment of the view."
581,trustpilot.com,"The train was an hour late only for it to constantly stop for a good while. It got to the point that it was way off schedule and decided to just stop minutes away from Union Station. It's also the same crew every Friday that the train is late and rude. When people kept asking about what's going on they were just saying ""they're on their way just sit down."" I hope someone decides to fix this or get a better crew to deal with this sort of stuff and just people who need the job to get by."
582,trustpilot.com,I wouldn’t even give one star if I were able. If you want to cancel your trip for medical reasons they require a “doctors excuse” from your doctor saying you can’t travel. No wonder nobody uses the train anymore.  My agents name is Ben in customer service. Call him.
583,trustpilot.com,"Absolute worst travel experience of my life. Trying to get from Los Angeles back home to Indiana has been a f****** nightmare, first a FIVE HOUR DELAY then another 3 on Barstow, CA. Rude staff very over priced food.

586,trustpilot.com,"Only sleeper cars can order from the dinner menu. Everyone else can pick from microwaved choices. How hard would it be to have salads, tuna sandwiches, hard boiled eggs or a scrambled bowl? I feel like I am on The ""Snow Piercer' train.  Now the microwave food is not available and we get to go hungry for dinner and all night because they can't ring us up. I guess this is my punishment for asking for food. Not even a cracker was offered. I only have 24 more hours of a 3 day trip. Now they say they'll take cash. Too bad I have none nor do they have an atm. Good thing I paid $300 for such a lovely time."
587,trustpilot.com,"I fully understand that this is a business, but I was absolutely mortified when the ticket agent told me the price of 2 round trip adult  tickets and a child ticket cost $427. For a trip to NYC for one day!!! I literally. could have gone to Cancun for these prices! Absolutely ludicrous!!! I had no choice but to buy them. I don't make that kind of money but had already purchased tickets to Aladdin, never again!"
588,trustpilot.com,Disquisted how the price is so high 604$ to n nyc to Delaware is absolutely pathetic Amtrak you should be ashamed of urself but me ill find another option
589,trustpilot.com,"I went on a 17 hour trip with my family which Involved having to move from train to train and each and every single Amtrak employee on the train was beyond rude to my family and myself. I have elders with me who can’t hear well and we were being yelled out and told the entire trainwas messed up because they accidentally sat in the wrong seat. At one point earlier in the trip on the way in, another employee, Tracy H. told us we could “handle this outside.” I understand that the employees might be tired, but itdoesn’t give them the right to belittle the passengers and ruin their experience. Safe to say we will no longer be traveling with Amtrak."
590,trustpilot.com,"Scott is one of the rudest customer service representatives I’ve ever dealt with - he yells, he’s condescending, eventually nice but thinks he can treat people like garbage in the process.

591,trustpilot.com,"On the phone for 2 hrs and 10 min.  Their ""we will call you back"" option didn't work.  ""Wait time over an hour"" -- I guess I could be on for another 4 hours and that caution would still be true.  Crap organization."
592,trustpilot.com,"I can't believe that while being in a first world country, The trains here have the worst upkip. 10 hour delay, they offered a terrible beef stue because of it. No real explanation on why the train is moving slow and why it stops every chance it gets and why it was it delay. The station are small with terrible upkip as well. I know I won't be taking a train ever again after a 10 hour delay."

594,trustpilot.com,"Horrendous misleading services on the site they ask you to choose coach, business or sleeper. I chose business class for all three legs of my journey. I know I did because the site made me confirm each one but still I was given coach for two out of the three trains. When I informed the ticket counter of this issue they said that we don't have a business class. 🙄. The bathrooms were filthy and in some cases not operational. The staff is rude and condescending. And now finally after 52 hours of travel I have to sit at my destination station and wait 2 hours for my checked bags to arrive.. let's go through this again, you scammed me for extra money on the ticket, treated me like a second class traveler and are now wasting my time further."
595,trustpilot.com,"After a 2 hour 17 minute hold for a customer service rep, an agent finally picked up. Then he asked if he could put me on hold again to be able to answer my very basic question. Another 15 minute hold, then I received an automated message stating that amtrak is now closed at 8pm and the phone line cut off. The agent also had my number yet never called back after the cutoff time. Nightmare service."
596,trustpilot.com,"Recently took a trip from Indianapolis to St Paul and had a great time. Seating was roomy and comfortable (especially in comparison to the airplane I took to get down there) and I had all the things on the train I needed. The scenery really made the trip special as well and I really loved the big windows to look out of. No complaints even though the train was late (all forms of transportation will arrive late sometimes). I would suggest a higher standard of sandwiches which I would gladly pay for, but otherwise I will be more than happy to board Amtrak again."

Wait time for customer service in calls was over an hour. Reps were rude and uninformative. My coastal starlight was delayed... First of all, they emailed me about it how archaic is that? Secondly the reps at the train station couldn't get me an estimate about when the train was coming. Amtrak sucks"
600,trustpilot.com,I was on the am track from wish ram WA to Spokane WA. The train rattled and jumped horribly stopped at Pasco for 10 minutes and was still 45 minutes early to Spokane I wonder how fast did this train go to get there so fast. Took it home an it was the most uncomfortable ride the seats were like siting on a bare board with no cushion . It rattled and jumped an after hearing about that train derailment I will never ride it again. I like my safety too much and it felt like I was in a tin can.
601,trustpilot.com,"Mr. Chris Lavander, an Amtrac representative at the Lorton Station in Virginia over heard my 88 year old mother tell me she could just lean against the cart while we wait 30 minutes until we could board the train and we had just gotten all the way out to our car and there was no seating left. Although my mom is a warrior that would not have been possible on her best day, Chris yelled over and said he would get her a folding chair and he took of going all the way back to the station and back almost to fast to be humanly possible revealing he was an angel. I wasn't surprised when I found out he was a veteran, a Navy Seabee. Mr. Lavander I salute you you made our trip may you be blessed as you have blessed us you our in our prayers. I hope Amtrak is taking care of this man people like him are a blessing to us all. Thank you again Sir."
602,trustpilot.com,"The food was great , our attendant was good ,our roomette was made for midgets .if amtrak would make the roomettes bigger it might be worth going. , we pay big bucks and have to sit in a 4 x 7 room for 2 days , no leg room , no beverage holders , everything slides off the shiny smooth tabletop ,lost our drinks at least 10 times , you have a 12 inch area to climb up on the top bunk, virtually no air conditioning ,sweated the whole time on the train , my wife went and took a shower and as soon as she was finished soaping up there was no more water in the shower. Baggage service is almost non existent . Tried to upgrade to a bigger room and $350 wasnt enough for amtrak considering that 1/2 of all the rooms were not even occupied, you would think that they wouldnt mind since they are empty and we are stuck playing twister in a roomette.,whoever runs this company should find another job because he definitely doesnt make good company decisions…;….."
603,trustpilot.com,Never again. Train conductor KB and  other employees on Spokane to Chicago train need to be fired.Abuse of authority. Train rattled horribly. Thought we were going to crash. Told attendant that the train felt unsafe as it rattled and leaned heavily on curves. He laughed at me. Train did crash on the way back to Montana. Wasted over $700 to be treated with complete disrespect and was completely unsafe.
604,trustpilot.com,I booked an Amtrak ticket from Anna Illinois to Chicago Illinois this last weekend to return home from a funeral. After taking Greyhound for my trip there which was actually from Rockford to Nashville I had decided I Wasn't taking Greyhound back home.....It was horrible! I had never taken Amtrak train and was nervous but it was a Great TRIP.......Great Customer Service. The works on the train were very helpful answering my questions and let me know which stop I could jump out and smoke a VERY Quick cigarette which I TRULY appreciated!!! I never tried the food on the train I had grabbed a sandwich from a close by jimmy John's before boarding and ate it on the train. It was a bit creepy along parts of the ride like seeing the car in front and backing swaying on the tracks. but overall it was a Great Ride. Very spacious! Super Comfy! I actually got some sleep finally!!!! I Really Enjoyed My First Ride in Amtrak and will ride again!!!!
605,trustpilot.com,I repeat.. I will not ride Amtrak ever again long distance!!! Im going to put a review down this is a hell trip! My trip was one way from San Francisco to Seattle after my run in San Francisco.I spoken with so called supervisor agent they will not provide me a hotel or pay for my lyft. They are lucky that I have extra funds to spend... Oh yes not really extra funds but the what the hell 50.00!! I'm nervous as hell taking lyft from Amtrak to my apartment. I asked to stay in the station for 4 hours till my bus comes. They closed the door as soon as you get your bags from the station. I was going to ride Amtrak through national parks next year I don't think so. Hell I might cancel my trip to Portland for next weekend that they may loose a customer. Pissed pissed pissed pissed pissed off.. I'm thankful I am not working with them. I thought they are a good employer with respecting service. I guess not. I can go on an on with this.My arrival time was 7:30pm an got to 1:30am. It was horrible of riding that many hours with a mask.
606,trustpilot.com,"Received an abrupt email about my reservation being changed. The email also stated ""you don't need to do anything, we've taken care of it, but if you have any questions, call us"". I checked the website and the same original reservation showed up.I called and was told that the wait is about 90 minutes. I picked the callback option and received a call about 2 hours later. For some reason, when I received the call back, I was placed on hold for another 20 minutes until I was speaking to a rep who was not at all helpful and extremely slow in responding to any questions. That phone call took another half an hour just for him to tell me that the ticket was indeed changed because he was so slow to respond. He told me to just show up to the station as my original ticket showed, until I asked ""but the new ticket has a different departure time?""By the way, the new itinerary has 2 stops including an 8-minute transfer to a bus. The original ticket was non-stop. I would not have booked had I known I would have to transfer twice."
607,trustpilot.com,"This was easily one of the worst travel experiences of my life. I’ve traveled on spirit air and that was LUXURY compared to my recent trip on Amtrak Downeaster. The train stopped in Haverhill and forced us to take a bus to Boston for 45 minutes. That would have been fine but on the way back, we arrived 45 minutes early to Enid’s we could at least sit near each other, just to have to bus we were ready to board suddenly pull away from us and refuse to let us board, forcing us to board a bus multiple rows away from us and our children for OVER AN HOUR back to the first stop on the train. On top of that, the drivers excuse for traffic back to the station (the entire reason for taking the train in the first place) was “well most of you are probably drunk anyway so ‘enjoy the ride’”. Needless to say I wond be using Amtrak again in the future when I can take the MTBA from 15 extra minutes away for 1/3 the price and without the enormous headache and inconvenience."
608,trustpilot.com,I purchased a one way Amtrak ticket from Raleigh to New Haven. I had a one way flight back the next day. The Amtrak was leaving 8:45 am -9:40 pm. My wife drops me off there and they never text me but tells me the train is delayed 2 hours. The worst is I miss my connecting train and will have to wait in D.C. for 6 hours arriving in New Haven at 5:00 am. I ask do you have some sort of lounging for me and they said no only for business class. I say you screwed up the timing you should make mine a business class. They say I have to ask them in D.C. but there are plenty places to eat. I say for 6 hours! I'm not going to wait until I get to D.C. to find out. Luckily I found a flight to Conneticut and got a refund but loss money on the flight.

My blind, mentally disabled son and I are on the Southwest Chief getting ready to arrive in LA tomorrow Friday at 8AM with no way to get home. I get a call our last train home to San Diego is cancelled. How are we supposed to get home? Hitchhike? I am beside myself and very upset. I got through once and Melissa put me on hold and then all of sudden I’m on a survey line asking how would rate my reservation experience? Why didn’t Melissa call me back? Are you kidding me? Almost five hours I’ve been on the phone. Nobody has provided a solution for us. You watch tomorrow when we show up, i will upset yet will be treated rudely because how dare I question them? This is quite an awful ending to our journey. I used to love Amtrak. Never again. Plus the music drives one insane. It scratchy and worse that the old elevator music they used to play in the 1970s. Five hours of it! Now it’s 10:12 PM and still on hold. Yet, every five minutes, passengers are threatened with the mask mandate and how you’ll be thrown off the train."
610,trustpilot.com,I’d give zero stars if I could. I had booked a ride on 9/3 for a train on 9/17 and just today (9/16) got a message saying the train had been cancelled. I called to talk to an agent and turned out there was railroad service planned for the whole weekend since 9/8 and notices were sent out today. A refund was never offered until I gave the call.

612,trustpilot.com,"I'll preface this review by saying that I think most of the issues with Amtrak are the fault of the government and lack of adequate funding. But they sure need to find nicer employees too. The quality of service continues to decline year after year, especially on long-distance trains. Maybe the service on the northeast corridor trains is great; I have seldom traveled on those. I get the feeling that the long-distance routes subsidize the northeast corridor trains, which if true, is so unfair. It seems like the D.C. based federal government (politicians and employees) wants to get rid of the national Amtrak network and just have their fancy new high-speed trains for their convenience in the northeast.I've taken many trips on Amtrak over the years, both short and cross country. Unless you're a train nut and/or hate/afraid of flying, do not use Amtrak. There are a few good/nice Amtrak employees, but most are surly, unprofessional, or downright mean. The bad experience starts with their website. It's impossible to plan a multi-stop, long-distance trip on the website. So, unfortunately one must get a reservations agent on the phone, which takes FOREVER. When one finally answers, they are very rude and impatient. I've even been scolded because I didn't understand their wacky website. IF you pursue this misadventure further and actually board a train, you'll most likely be riding on ancient passenger cars staffed by yet more angry, bitter, unprofessional, surly, and power-mad employees. The passenger cars' HVAC systems are ancient as well and can't make use of HEPA filters (to rid the air of covid). Mask wearing is enforced only sporadically. None of the windows open (not even an inch), even in the private rooms. The food is HORRIBLE and is served on/in plastic which is NOT biodegradable I'd bet. There are frequent disruptions and late trains. I and my friends have experienced waits ranging from three to 20+ hours! And Amtrak does not keep you informed about these disruptions. You'll be sitting there (sometimes literally) in the dark in some remote area with no bathroom or anything to eat or drink. To sum up, Amtrak is only a good idea for rail fans and people who don't fly and MUST get someplace and can't drive."
613,trustpilot.com,Capital Limited has an awesome team. This crew is amazing at accommodating the passengers. Excellent service with smiling faces were aboard my train. Thank you so much for making our train ride great today. Special thanks to Robert Jones Jr for his extra care with his passengers.
614,trustpilot.com,"We are people. Not cattle. This will be my first and LAST trip ever on Amtrak trains. The conductors are liars, the time frame is skewed in a horrific manner, the food is the cheapest quality for top dollar prices and 14 hours is WAAAAY too long to keep someone cramped in a train seat that only reclines about 25 degrees. Awful awful awful"
615,trustpilot.com,"The problem for Amtrak in September , 2021 is that their long distance sleeper cars are old and should have been replaced years ago. Some the controls in the sleeper do not work. The ventilation in my car was poor. Someone broke the rules and had a smoke in the downstairs bathroom. Soon the entire car could smell it, even if you had your door shut. The shower room below had a slow drain and soon the water had piled up an inch deep. I had to stop showering before I was even half done. These old cars are grimy and not well maintained. So I have a problem with the aging equipment which is slowly being replaced with new cars. Wait a year or two before you book a sleeper roomette. The crew tries to give good service but the old cars and trackage work against them. They need more staff."
616,trustpilot.com,"This was the worst experience I have ever had travelling. First and last time taking a train. We were onboard for 3 days with no A/C, the attendants were rude, horrible and all acted like they hated their jobs. The intercom didn't work and we told the crew and they didn't care we missed all the announcements and were completely left in the dark about states and stops. On top of that there was no food because they ran out of everything or the employees would get to the food 1st. I would not recommend this service to anyone!!!"
617,trustpilot.com,"A huge reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because of the fact their trains don't have wifi for long haul rides. Just short haul. It's insane to have to sit there 12 hours. Another reason was cause coach couldn't use the dining car. Cause of covid they only let the sleeper car passengers use it. Give me a break. They sitting people next to each other on the train, strangers yet wouldn't let us use the dining car where we would be sat at tables. All in all it was a nice ride, people were nice and once we got the seating straight and I got to sit next to my friend. I was happy."
618,trustpilot.com,"I have no problem with the train rides themselves, but the website is archaic. I can't buy tickets for anyone with a different last name than me, which while perhaps unintentional, is sexist. You can't buy tickets for your partner with another last name, kids, sisters, etc. Very uncool. The option to ""modify the traveller"" is also misleading. You cannot transfer the ticket to another person; you must cancel the reservation and have the other person repurchase. Additionally, it's annoying that you can't pay with a combination of money and rewards points; you need to have enough points to make an entire purchase (unless some way to apply after the fact?). These issues (especially diff last names) need to be fixed ASAP."

621,trustpilot.com,My experience was disgusting. I was sexually assaulted on the train and I didn't even get an apology from the crew. Everything was handled with no regard for the victim.

Coming from New York my train was 2 1/2 hours late I missed my ride to North Station which made me in return missed my train you cannot call customer service because they do not pick up the phone I have been sleeping outside in Boston waiting for the  station to open Absolutely no regard for their customers whatsoever I have never been so disgusted in my life. This is the worst travel experience in my entire life again I will never take Amtrak for as long as I live. The most unprofessional outfit I’ve ever came across Greyhound makes these people look like a Toyota compared to a Ferrari. Never again if I could give a negative star I would

Thanks for wasting my entire day..really bad, just really poor everything..my biggest question is how come were always stopping because something's wrong or the schedules are constentaly getting switched up so everyone has to find a diffrent route...take your money and mostly your time somewhere else, dont bring any service to amtrak."
628,trustpilot.com,"The Amtrak Website misrepresents their policy for Covid schedule changes. When making the booking they claim no charges for changes to the schedule. However they have no way to do any change other than an e-voucher. Amtrak sent a voucher for only 75% of the ticket price. Nowhere in phone menu or online does it say you pay a 25% penally. On the contrary, their website stated ""Amtrak is waiving all change fees for reservations made by January 4, 2022""A dishonest organization with no accountability. Better fly or drive."
629,trustpilot.com,You guys need to do better and especially with ya phone service i have tried to reach a agent for over 3 weeks about my refund everytime i call im on hold for 2 to 3 hours and still dont get to talk to anyone this is really sad you expect me to pay that amount of money for a trip and nothings right its packed on the train people standing up until someone gets off then they can sit down you guys dont need the money that bad that is ridiculous why are yall packing the train like that knowing its still covid smh the worst service ever yall need to get it together
630,trustpilot.com,"This is the most spectacularly incompetent organization I have ever seen. My teenage daughter was supposed to have a simple train trip from Iowa to Michigan to go back to college. In the car it is seven hours, by Amtrak it is supposed to take 11 hours. It has now turned into a nightmare experience for her traveling alone today. First the train was 2 1/2 hours late to leave, with of course no prior notice. She was too late to catch her connecting train in Chicago, and although the company told us the connecting train would probably wait for the passengers the train left. We were told that if this occurred they would charter a bus to take the passengers the rest of the way to Michigan. Nope. My daughter is now being told that she is being given a hotel voucher and that she is on her own to take a cab ride at her own expense to the hotel which is 20 minutes away. She then has to take another cab ride back to the train station tomorrow for another several hour train trip to her final destination. While all this was going on, of course we spent hours on the phone trying to get through customer service, which was a very little help. Don’t ever, repeat ever, do business with Amtrak. Absolutely infuriating experience with these incompetent bozos."

My brother had to jump out of moving train in Newport News and scratched his both arms and legs cos train first of all was late, and he helped me to get my bag inside as I had my kid sleeping in my hands. You guys do not know anything about customer service! Terrible workers of Amtrak, wish u the worst job than you have. And the girl whatever her name kicked us from disabled sit to find any other available, she wasted our time.  Never ever deserve even to think to buy tickets for those trains."
632,trustpilot.com,"There were six of us from Indy, traveling Amtrak from Chicago to Glacier National Park. We purchased our vacation from Amtrak vacations, who is not owned by Amtrak. The Chicago culture is not as friendly as most places, but the Amtrak people in Chi-town were just downright mean and had some serious control issues. UP AGAINST THE WALL, one man spitting his words to several of us in line pointing, so a slow moving cart could come around the corner. The woman in the Metro Lounge was just as nasty, not so much as giving their guests eye contact. Spouting the rules and regs to park your luggage in the undersized closet. By God you aren’t getting your luggage back if you don't have your green ticket. Every single Union station worker was on this power trip. One of our six is a petite 55 year old woman who asked for help with her bag to get onto the train 1000’ down the track. By the time the conversation was over, she was in tears. Less hassle than the airlines? I think not. Once we were on the train, the 🧑‍✈️ was very welcoming and helpful. The car and roomette was worn and grimy but oh well at least we felt welcome. It wasn’t long before the subject of meals came up. The 👩‍✈️ ask if we want 5pm or 6:45. We chose the later and finally by 9pm they allowed us in the dining car. The meal was as good as train food can be and the folks serving it up worked hard. I assume they were short handed because this is what they repeatedly told us on the way out and back.  The 👩‍✈️ Made up our beds for us (dont forget to tip) and I slept in the upper while my wife had the lower. Not the best night sleep I ever had, its a train…but at 3am I awoke with 16 bed bug bites. My buddy across the hall had two. My RN wife and buddy didn’t believe me that it was bedbugs. Two days later in Glacier we met a Nurse Practioner who had the same problem and went to an after hours clinic. They confirmed it was indeed bed bugs. Yikes! Hey, it happens, right? I bet it would happen less if they would vacuum and clean. I notified the conductor  and as he shook his head in a not again sort of way, assured me that the car would be taken out of service and fumigated. Not sure if that included cleaning. The conductor handed me an incident report and gave me a look like don’t let the door hit you on the butt. The fine people from all over the US working the short summer at the park were well trained and downright helpful in every way. With every problem a response was heard from them, you are with Amtrak vacations? They knew of their shortcoming and the work arounds to fix them.I wont go into all of the screw-ups that this disorganized company made, but there were plenty including over charging and canceling excursions at the last minute. Want to talk with someone on the phone. Get ready to sit for an hour and wait.The trip out thru the plains was mildly interesting if you are the sort of person who can find beauty in anything. The trip back was the same in reverse. Then return to the cow lines in Union Station with their dogs barking at our heals. When people ask how my trip was I ask them if they remember the Chevy Chase vacation movies? Oh, one more thing, a week or two after retuning home a fat letter came from Amtrak. At last an apology or maybe 10% off a ticket or two. Nope, a letter stating if you want to make a claim (reimbusrement for medical) fill out these 80 forms and be sure to give us you SS#, insurance company name, sign this disclaimer etc, Yeah, I’m goin‘ do that."
633,trustpilot.com,"DO NOT TRUST THE WEBSITE WHEN IT SAYS REFUNDABLE.  Purchase your ticket only if you decide to leave through Am Trak for sure, if not sure, find another source of transportation.  First they make you wait on the phone until you almost quit, and then they sneak in “cancellation fees”.  I can understand if you decide to quit last minute, but 3 days before, wow!  This company sucks!"
634,trustpilot.com,"Almost always late. Not uncommon for it to be several hours late. And for some reason the refuse to provide ANY info or transparency on why they're late or to provide any realistic idea of when the train might arrive via text. Food choices if you have a room are worse than ever. No more real plates or flatware.. cheap plastic only. Snack bar is a joke. They announce they're open and you walk all the way there only to find their credit card machine isn't working.. and they don't take cash (so why did you even bother to announce the snack bar is open?) All the cars are old and ratty. A lot of the employees are very nice (but also too many with an attitude). But even if all the employees were amazing, it wouldn't make up for all the bad stuff. The old ratty cars don't bother me, nor the occasional surly employee or the lousy food and poor food selection, if only they could be remotely on time. Or barring that, TELL US WTH IS GOING ON so we could plan!  I could go on but you get the picture."
635,trustpilot.com,"As a novice train customer, it would be great to know up front and in no uncertain terms online that some tickets are basically Greyhound tickets. If I had wanted to ride a Greyhound bus, I'd have purchased a ticket through that particular business. Or I'd have taken a community transit bus for 1/4 of the cost and had much more room. My 9 year old is pretty disappointed."
636,trustpilot.com,"I sit in an old cabin interior that creaks with age as it slowly moves over an aging, bumpy, poorly mantained track. I listen to garbled words over an intercom that buzzes and sometimes squeeks, enduring multiple unscheduled stops to arrive at my station an hour and a half late. This was my experience. The entire executive team at Amtrak needs to be replaced with real leaders from Europe and Asia who know what they're doing. Amtrak is a national disgrace."
637,trustpilot.com,"I tried several times to purchase tickets today on line and each time the Amtrak on-line portal ""froze up"".  I tried calling customer service and the automated reply service said the wait time for an Amtrak customer representative was over 1 hour.   I am not going to bother with trying to make any further reservations with Amtrak"
638,trustpilot.com,"They sent me an email offering an business class upgrade lottery. My offer was accepted. My seat was one of the only two seats facing the rear of the train, with a customer sitting in front of me (facing me), with no reclining feature as the seat is flush up against the bathroom wall. Thanks a lot Amtrak! Never again!"
639,trustpilot.com,If I could give an -0I would very inconsiderate of customers money they have spent and travel time’s.There has been a number of extreme excuses made about Covid rulers and regulations.Amtrak has “So very Rude Employees”.Especially the ones walking up and down the aisle.We pay a lot of money have to follow a lot of rules.”What about Customer Service and Care”????Rules should have to apply to Amtrak Employees as well.Lower your Rates if your not going to Service Customers politely and Be more Cautious and respectful of the Schedule Times and Arrivals.
640,trustpilot.com,"Took the train to Portland Oregon and it went fine on the way there. On the way back, we had gotten a 4pm train, it got cancelled and there was no notification of the cancellation. Arrived at the station and that’s when we found out there was no train coming. Luckily there was another train at 7:30pm but even that train showed up an hour late with no updates on its whereabouts. Not sure if this is a Portland thing or a general Amtrak issue. Hopefully the former."
641,trustpilot.com,"I want to give NO stars! Amtrak is one of the MOST unsafe mode of transportation I have ever been on.  There was a fire on our train.  The fire extinguisher is OUTSIDE the train car, so we had to PRY open the door to get to the extinguisher.  The employees on our train did not know what to do or how to react in an emergency situation.  The train car filled with smoke 2 times and the employees did NOTHING but tell us to stay seated.  We were not allowed to get out of the train car. Unbelievable!  The fire was near a high voltage box, but no one seemed to care.  As a rider, I had to put out the fire myself.  The emergency might be considered an ""act of God"", but the response from Amtrak is deplorable.  Safety is NOT Amtrak's priority.  I put in a claim for Amtrak to pay my medical bills since I was injured, but they took an entire year and a half to FINALLY call me to say they were covering NOTHING.  Amtrak can sure give someone the ""run around""....that they are good at. BTW....we never got where we were going and did not get any help to get a new ticket or a refund.  Consideration for their passengers is at an all time LOW!  I did not hire a lawyer because I am naive and believe in doing what is right and believed Amtrak would do the same....my mistake."
642,trustpilot.com,"I called Amtrak and was told there would be a 3 hour wait time and I could get a call back . I got call back at 12:05 am. I was put on hold for another 42 minutes with no connection. I finally hung up. The next day I called again and left another call back number. I received call 1 hour later and waited another 6 minutes. Andre the customer service rep-with an accent mark over the e as he made sure he told me ,misunderstood me when I said I received an e ticket he sent. He believed I said I didn’t get it. He proceeded to put me in my place telling me I had to wait and I had no business telling him I didn’t get it so quickly.I said I didn’t say that and he proceeded to tell me he heard  it with his own ears. Amtrak supervisors please review the tape. Sunday 8/1 at approximately 12:15 pm"
643,trustpilot.com,"The absolute Best experience ever!!! Ms. Florence and Jermaine were on point!!! Accommodating, pleasant, just Awesome!!! I did those 8 hours on the train like a Champ!!! Only because of them!!! Amazing People!!! Both of them!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
644,trustpilot.com,"No customer service on phone, at station, or on train. Sent my disabled sister from Flagstaff to Santa Fe... Never again. Confusing information at both ends that conflicted with what was on our printed ticket. Employees just shrug their shoulders and claim they don't know anything about checking your luggage for you, even though our ticket said to show up 45 minutes early to check luggage. No ramp provided for handicapped travelers. My sister said she would rather take a bus next time.  Amtrak ignored ADA rules. Don't get taken in by their photos showing nice seating, service, etc. It isn't accurate. I called to complain... Still waiting for a call back."
645,trustpilot.com,"This train is almost more than 2 hours late with no update from staff, ill never do this again"
646,trustpilot.com,"If there was a way to give no stars I would. The train is always delayed. Bought tickets for my friend on the southwest chief to NM and they were on time. At the union station in Ca she was told that she had to empty some of her stuff because her suitcase was to heavy. My friend then proceeded to throw away some of books that she was bringing with her into a locked trash can. After she did this, the lady at the counter said oh you can buy a box for $5.00 that you can put your stuff in. Then you can bring it on the train. My poor friend was in tears as these books were precious to her and now there gone forever. Then the train was over 2 hours late. To top it all off, the crew was rude. I’m so done!"
647,trustpilot.com,"Trip from Ann Arbor, MI to Chicago. Train was 25 minutes late to arrive. As I type this, we're stopped on the tracks because of some construction that is apparently happening that is preventing us from passing through. They cannot tell us when we'll be able to start moving again. It's already been about 30 minutes. Umm....this is a scheduled train. Why is this happening? Shouldn't construction times be coordinated with the train schedule??  Ridiculous! We were already running like an hour behind schedule. Now it's going to be more like 2 hours!!!  Awful! I'm wasting my vacation time sitting on a stationary train in the middle of nowhere. Thanks, Amtrak!"
648,trustpilot.com,Train 28 was late coming into Chicago to meet train 30 to Pittsburgh. Train left without my wife. Stuck her in motel for 24 hrs with 10.00 for food.
649,trustpilot.com,"Attempted to book my tickets online. Clicked 'purchase' and received an error message that the 'booking system was unable to process my request, please try again later'. Tried calling the help line and was informed they had 1.5 hour wait times. We need to do better than this."
650,trustpilot.com,"Rude rude rude! Don’t bother riding the train unless you want to be belittled. Did the bid up option and never got an email either way, it’s specifically states that you get an email if it’s accepted or not accepted, got to the train station 30 minutes in advance and the rude guy working said he didn’t know. I said the email stated I would get an email either way and he said well apparently you didn’t get it. And wouldn’t help me upgrade at the station."

652,trustpilot.com,"After over 20 years where I’ve always taken Amtrak both single day and multiple day travel and enjoyed it, I see it coming to and end. I understand with Covid now things have to be redone or revised or restructured for safety. However to be on a train that is solely only feeding people in the dining car that are in the sleeping car seems very unbalanced to me, and the people who are in coach the only way we can eat is if we go to the snack car. I purchased my tickets online so for the second time this week I had contacted Amtrak asking  some questions and for the 2nd time I got a very rude customer representatives.  But at this point once I get done with this next trip that I have I will not take another train ride. And that saddens me because it’s my preferred way to travel!  Nothing not even COVID should make it ok to treat customers like that.  The fact that I can’t eat in the dining car unless I’ve paid an Exorbitant amount of money is ridiculous!  So thank you Amtrak for making me feel like I’m feeling now!  If you are opening up the train where anyone and everyone can sit on the train with anyone even if you don’t know them what’s the reason for Segregating people in coach to not be able to eat in the dining car?  Well my money will be getting after this trip that’s too bad so very disappointing."
653,trustpilot.com,"HORRIFIC CUSTOMER RELATIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CUSTOMER RELATIONS.... got notifications my sons train was 45 minutes late and 5 minutes later got notification it was ontime WE RACED TO THE STATION WHILE TRYING TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LISTENED TO AUTOMATED MESSAGE FOR AT LEAST 5 minutes. Finally got the message ""transferring you to a customer service agent"" um then ""your wait time is 1.5 hours"".... HELPFUL. NOT! Missed train. NOT HAPPY. Never again. Worst experience ever. Never again."
654,trustpilot.com,"We were coming from Philly and the train was first a half hour late, then we get on the train and there is no seating so I paid for a seat that said reserved, then have no seat.

657,trustpilot.com,"We decided to splurge for a sleeper car from Portland to Seattle and after a 2.5 hour delay, we finally boarded.  Thirty min into the trip we wanted a drink and went to the lounge to find a sign stating it was closed for an hour bc the attendant was on dinner break.  We then went to the dining car and were met with a real attitude of a waiter.  The waiter said the train had no refrigeration so no cold beer or wine.  The service was horrible - these employees do not like customers!  I asked if they could chill some wine and of course they could not.  We went back to the lounge car when it re-opened and we’re told they only had water.  No apologies.  I’ve never seen anything like this and obviously will not be taking another Amtrak train!"
658,trustpilot.com,"Our trip to New York on 6/18/21 from Denver was delayed 5 hours. When we boarded, we were told to sit anywhere so we sat downstairs by the bathrooms which was great for us, but we were hustled upstairs by a porter that was rude. The stairs are not friendly to older people and that staircase is not a good idea as only one person fits at a time.  The bathrooms were so filthy that wipes were useless and you either stepped through pee, or stuck to the floor! Wasing your hands (laugh) the sink was a toilet bowl.  We were in coach, yes and treated like scum on your shoe.  I was expecting to at least sit in the dining room, NO, you are not one of our sleeper passengers! We had an overcooked hot dog,a hamburger,two bags of lunch box chips and two cokes, price 22.00! Half the hot dog was overcooked.  The observation car was like a sauna so could not stay in there.  We changed trains in Chicago to the Lakeshore. The workers were so helpfull. The train was all on one level and we had more legroom.  It was easier to move about but again the bathrooms were so filthy even though they were bigger.  We learn sometimes the hard way and we learned never take the train!!"
659,trustpilot.com,"Overall our experience was ok, and considering the affordability, it was more than ok.  Our first train from OMA to CHI was two hours late.  Also, considering how long some people are on the trains, I DEFINITELY  think a vegetable and a fruit option need to be added to the dining cart.  There was not a single vegi or fruit to purchase, and a banana or apple of carrot sticks could be added for very low cost/waste! What I did enjoy was the friendly staff and very comfy coach seats.  I would definitely travel this way again."
660,trustpilot.com,"Where to start. We heard every excuse in the book for delays- switching issues, lightning striking signals, traffic, etc. etc. These are all things you should be able to account for when you run the same route every day. Their process for seating folks is archaic and chaotic- you get a different set of directions from every porter. No assigned seats in coach. Some folks that got on later had no place to sit.  The system is so inefficient and needs to be totally revamped. We really need an effective alternative to driving and flying but this is not it.  Before we give more funding to Amtrak to expand, they really need to lmprove what they are already doing."
661,trustpilot.com,"Took teenaged grandsons on trip from Atlanta to NYC. Going, the trip was good, DeWayne, our attendant, provided excellent service. Being a foodie, both meals were not tasty. The Holiday Inn was acceptable and the mobile police unit in front made for feelings of safety. Breakfast was not provided although it was supposed to be included. Hotel had no dining facility. Staff was very attentive and courteous. The place to redeem Big Bus voucher was no longer at Madam T so had to search and finally found it outside the M&M store. I recommend changing bus services to Top View because our tour was very disappointing, staff very rude when asked simple questions. Missed out on using any of the attractions on City Pass which were included. All attractions closed by 6:pm and would have had to go by taxi, Uber, or Subway to visit them. Overall, pretty disappointed with the included items. I don’t feel I got what I paid for."
662,trustpilot.com,"Rude, rude and rude staff. Don't do this, get out of there. No wifi, filthy bathrooms, 4 hours late, not a pleasant experience as their marketing suggests. The views? None...as most of the trip is traveling through overgrown brush on both sides of the track. What you do see are the poorest, most run down sections of the major cities the train passes through. Horrible experience."
663,trustpilot.com,"SO uncomfortable! My elderly mother and I paid a small fortune to travel from Boston to Denver. The roomette was TINY, the seats were hard as bricks, and the upper bunk had a foot and a half clearance. I had to move around like Gollum. Announcements are supposed to stop at 10 pm, but they continued to blare over the loudspeaker in my ear until 11:30 pm. Needless to say, we do NOT want to make the 3 day return trip. I contacted an agent and explained that the trip caused ACTUAL, PHYSICAL pain, and that we wanted to cancel the return trip. I was told that not only would they not refund the money, we would only receive a credit that would need to be used within a year. By US. We are the only ones who can use the credit.  WHY WOULD WE EVER WANT TO RIDE THE TRAIN AGAIN IF WE HATED IT SO MUCH IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE WANTED TO CANCEL IT???I'm sure my adult children could find some use for this credit if I were able to transfer it to them. I don't know why the company cares who uses the tickets, as long as they're getting their money. So we're stuck with 2 choices.Cancel the return trip and eat the $1400 we spent, or suck it up and go through 3 more days of hell to get home. Not cool, Amtrak.Not cool. (Oh and I almost forgot, the agent with whom I spoke was SO. RUDE. Not even the obligatory insincere apology was offered.)"
664,trustpilot.com,We were surprised by the shabby condition of the bedroom in the decades old sleeper car. The staff was arrogant and impatient with us except for one dumpy dressed lady in the cafe car and one very nice male attendant both of whom made that leg of our trip almost bearable. My wife got bitten twice by what I believe to be bed bugs. I personally felt something crawling on me but wasn't bitten. May be my last Amtrak roundup.
665,trustpilot.com,"Right now I am grateful Amtrak put me in a nice hotel. Very nice.  But it hardly makes up for what my husband , daughter and I put up with today.  Our train was delayed 6 hours so instead of leaving at 7 PM we left at 1 AM. But I can understand that things happen but what was a million times worse was the way we were treated by staff.  Not all but most of the staff deserves to be fired !!! Very rude and condescending. No clear communication.  Is it because it is government run ?  We have a business of our own and if I would treat my clients and customers the way we were treated today I would lose my business.  If you respond to this and let me know action was taken and staff was made aware of their inappropriate actions I may change my mind but I may never ride Amtrak again and I will make sure my friends and family don’t either. When getting off the train a couple was in front of us and the man was in a wheelchair. Instead of taking the time to set up a ramp the staff just bumped him off the train.  Rude and insensitive!!! We traveled from Denver to Chicago on July 4th .  The staff at the Chicago station were great.  I’m not normally a negative or complaining person but I had enough today. And you should take note because according to your reviews I’m not the only one."
666,trustpilot.com,We took the train round trip from Denver to Hlenwood Springs for a weekend visit. We were so disappointed.  Train 2 hours late leaving  of Denver and over three hours late leaving Glenwood Springs returning to Denver. Train was dirty the vents above the seats were plugged with dust and dirt. We just had coach seats as it is only a 5 hour ride....when we were on the train we learned coach passengers were not eligible to dine in the dining car..what? Why were we not toldthis when we booked? Glenwood springs Station has hardly any benches outside. Really a pretty awful experience.  Shame on you Amtrak...we do not get vacation time to often...this was a huge disappointment. I would recommend making other plans.
667,trustpilot.com,"Made multiple calls, texts, chats  to Amtrak regarding my vehicle’s ability to fit on the auto train. I was assured it would fit. When I got specific requesting to speak to a vehicle specialist One agent hung up on me others told me their are no specialists.  When arrived at Lortan VA the guy measured my vehicle and it was too large for the auto train"
668,trustpilot.com,"We just returned from a trip on the Empire Builder between St. Paul and Chicago. We were two hours late arriving in St. Paul and two-and-a-half hours late coming home. We had only our lunch and no dinner; food service is very poor quality and insanely expensive ($17 for 2 drinks and a snack sized popcorn.)We were so late returning to Chicago that it was another two hours until the next commuter train to our town and so our ride from the commuter station to our house was canceled. We had to scramble to arrange for another ride and instead of arriving home around 5, we got there at about 11 p.m.  There's no WiFi on the train and the electrical outlets did not work so I had to go to another car to charge my phone.Masking was enforced haphazardly. I had mine, but when I pulled it down for awhile I was admonished while others in the car, who hadn't any mask in their possession, were ignored. The long trip home was exhausting. We could have driven It in 6 hours but taking Amtrak made it about 15."
669,trustpilot.com,I too took the Texas Eagle.  The crew was rude and abusive.  I seen one who repeatedly threatened to throw people off of the train.  I'm finished with train travel.
670,trustpilot.com,"I paid $66  for a two hour ride from Hudson to NYC, which is way more expensive  than Metronorth. The train arrived more than half an hour late and continued  to lose time because  they are too cheap to spend the money to negotiate  a decent passage on the tracks and we followed a local train down the tracks being held on the tracks frequently, finally arriving in NYC after close to four hours. Faster to walk!!!!"
671,trustpilot.com,"Vacation from hell!!! Worst business decisions and completely NOT customer oriented. They switched my reservation without my consent and couldn't use proper means of contacting me to tell me. 8 had booked my family room over 6 months in advance and my family got booted and some other family got our seats. Turned into over a 14 hour wait for the next flight, had to pay for an extra nights hotel stay, and an extra days car rental. Shameful!!! Most worthless company ever!! Even Trump's Taj Mahal casino is a better company than garbage Amtrak. Amtrak = Sweaty Asscrak!"

Going to LA with Cardinal & Southwest Chief was smooth sailing,,,.took me three days only as per schedule....good service and assistance from the room attendants with special mention to Doris.She was a sweetheart!Coming back, I took the Texas Eagle from LA to Chicago. I was so disappointed with food service & assistance. I spent three nights in a sleeper room without knowing who the room assistant is. Different people came knocking my door getting my lunch orders. A lady took my order for a cup of tea....didn't get it. The following day, I didn't order breakfast, just a cup of tea. Announced breakfast is closed, never get my tea again. Pressed the attendant button, nobody came. Is that good service? Arrival in Chicago was supposed to be at 1:52 p.m....arrived past 7pm.,,,missed my train! Thanks for the complimentary hotel I had a restful night. From Chicago back to Newark Penn was ok ...got the service i expected. My thanks to Ameerah at Pittsburgh Station, Ferry of Capitol Limited, Richard of Pennsylvanian, & Tranhardner, the Red Cap Attendant at Newark Penn. They made sure i get the assistance I needed."
675,trustpilot.com,Riding Amtrak from Charlotte to Baltimore was one of the worst travel experiences I have yet to encountered. The ride itself was ok but the staff not so much.. My family of 5 including my Grandmother and Aunt who are 69 and 80  were also treated very poorly by Amtrak staff. This started from the moment we walked into the train station until we arrived in Baltimore. The ride back home was nothing like the ride there... The attendants seemed to make it their business to have nasty attitudes. Our family was grieving during this time and headed to home going services for a family member so the added stress from the staff made our unexpected trip 10 times worst.
676,trustpilot.com,"Unfortunately after not having  taken the train in a few years , I can say it hasn’t improved!The stations are usually ok  but the Bathrooms are not attended to.  Recently my trip was a combination of delays, poor internet  and listening to an extremely loud foul mouthed woman .  Here disgusting , offensive mouth was heard by many nearby for the entire trip.  Call after call (to everyone she knew) she reiterated her story about  being robbed( not so eloquently stated)  at the Utica station in upstate NY.   No one walks/monitors   the train cars so you can’t even request assistance/complain. Changing seats wouldn’t help that’s how loud she was. 4 hours turned  into a 6 hour nightmare. I’ll stick to driving , gas would have been less even at $3/gallon, drive time 4 hrs.  The peace and quiet of the car is worth the effort I’d like a refund!"

I just finally asked, because it was getting close to our arrival. We have people waiting for us that had to have another car come along to hold us all. So ridiculous to not have gotten any notice. This is the Coast Starlight train."
679,trustpilot.com,Took the train because me and my partner thought it would be easier on the baby and it was. Had a good experience all up until on the return journey I  got triggered by one of the employees telling me if my child makes noise I'll have to relocate. First off the baby was eating a bottle and very tired. About to sleep and some self important fat man wants to flex imaginary authority over a child whimpering for a brief moment while he lost grip on the bottle. Glad that the train is so family friendly. If you don't want children in the quiet cars which is no different at all from the regular coach you should make that clear instead of passive aggressive comments that make your customers angry and uncomfortable. Train 170 from NYC to Boston South station. June 7
680,trustpilot.com,"Disgusting, bathrooms like portopotty are never cleaned.alcohol is sold so drunk men urinate on everything..NOT FOR TRAVELING WITH CHILDREN. Changing table folds down OVER the toilet seat. There is no bathroom big enough to accommodate a child and parent. Cafe car is very far and downstairs as well as bathrooms. My ticket said downstairs but were no downstairs seating. HORRIBLE. NOT ACCOMMODATING FOR MINORS."
681,trustpilot.com,"The horrible lack of communication through Amtrak Vacations is our biggest complaint. April 2021 we arrived at the Maricopa AZ station at 5am to head to New Orleans only to learn the train would be SIX HOURS LATE! No notification by text or email! We didn’t get to our hotel until 4am only to rise at 7:30am for a city bus tour. Then later that day we arrived at 6pm for our scheduled steamboat cruise with jazz and dinner only to learn it was canceled several days prior due to mechanical issues. Again NO communication. I wrote Amtrak on 4/30 for a refund and today is 5/25 and no response to our letter. I just now spoke to Amtrak guest relations (on hold 40 min) and there was no awareness of our canceled cruise. Fortunately she believed me and will refund the $216 on our credit card. Additionally, if you are on a schedule, Amtrak is not a good choice. Even on our return trip we never arrived at any stop on time. We will not use Amtrak again."
682,trustpilot.com,Took the big chief from river side CA. To Albuquerque new mexico in 2019. When I boarded the train their was a white albino male sitting on the chair next to my ticket location. When I proceed to sit down he made a comment about my presence next to him. When the ticket master came threw I brought the situation to his attention. He told me to shut up and sit down. I refused to sit next to this racist bigot. The worst thing about this situation is I had to ride your train standing up from River side CA. To Albuquerque NM. At one point a group of people came up to me looked up and down and left. This experiance is the last time I will ever ride this toilet dirty so called fun experience. Anthony e sanchez
683,trustpilot.com,"My husband and I rode on the Texas eagle on 5/7/2021 to Dallas Tx. 1).  Staff not disinfecting the seat or restrooms on a daily due to Cov19. Restrooms very nasty. Chances of catching cov19 on these trains are high. A fight broke out on train due to a man excessively cough and he was not thrown off train because he was sick. Amtrak don’t inspect their customers for temperatures checks or wellness check up. Poor selection of food and high prices. My seating section was so dirty, I asked for a vacuum or broom so I can clean my area. The man with the white shirt told me they don’t have cleaning items on the train. On the way back 5/10, train 421. A Spanish man calling people N word loud on the train . I am person of color so I was so upset. I didn’t say anything because I wanted to get home. Amtrak trains are nasty. Not safe to ride because of Cov19. Worker don’t clean trains or disinfect seat after each customers ride. Never again!!!!"
684,trustpilot.com,"By far my worst experience ever especially being it my first time riding with Amtrak. I found myself kind of being stuck in Reston, VA as I was seeking last minute flights back to Florida. Tix were so expensive ($200-$300) for a one way, so I was trying different alternatives for finding a way back home. I discovered that Amtrak station was not far from where I was currently staying with a friend. I booked the tix at $155 one-way to Ftl thinking I could relax, read, and finish up with work. Boy was I in for a rude awakening! Everything was smooth until the train took off. I had my own mask and was minding my own business until a staff collecting tix stopped in my area. He asked me where I was headed and told him Fort Lauderdale. He then asked me to adjust my mask so that it covered my nose, in which I did. Assumed he did not like my mask, he pulled out an extra one and told me to put that mask on in which I did. 30 mins later same dude walks by and ask me to pull up my mask. I looked at him and said, ""Sir my mask is on, what more do you want?"" He claimed it wasn't over my nose enough. In my head, I'm thinking ""Is this dude serious??!!"" In any case, I pulled my mask up and continued doing what I was doing (reading and listening to music). Then like 40-45 mins later same dude comes BACK around (mind you its like 10/11pm) and stops in my area. He asked again for me to adjust my mask. I had to stop and think for a moment and really ask myself, ""Is this dude just going to harass me the whole time about how to ""properly"" where this damn mask? Keep in mind barely no one was on the train. I clearly was abiding by the six feet social distancing rule and my mask was on. So I said to him, ""Sir, not sure exactly how you want me to wear this mask you gave me because I believe I am wearing it properly but if you would like me to wear tape to properly hold up my mask over my whole nose you can definitely bring some so I can gladly adjust to your liking"". He must've got pissed because he comes back with his supervisor. His supervisor now asks me what the issue is in which I let her know I didn't think there was one. She mentioned its Amtrak policy to cover all of nose and mouth with mask. I tell her that is what I am doing, but keep in mind people do have to eat and drink and when this happens the mask cannot be on my face. I also asked her to bring me tape and if this would satisfy her staff from harassing me especially that I am a paying customer. She returns with the police, Wow!!! I was asleep as it was past midnight and I wake up to lights being shined in my face. I get escorted off the train in a town I never heard of before and when I get inside the station they tell me the next train isn't until the next day at night and I would have to buy another ticket. Are you f#$%^ kidding me???!!! I call customer service and they refused to issue a refund. What an experience!!!! Not sure if I should blame China covid or Amtrak because as a first time passenger on this train, they definitely treated me and a few others as if we were not paying customers and disregarded us off their train in the middle of nowhere as if we hopped on for free. Even the cops who escorted myself & others off the train was in shock when he found out that we got kicked off over a mask!!!! Though this event just happened, I most certainly will be fighting Amtrak and disputing w/my credit card on this $155 transaction. Not only is Amtrak refusing to even give me partial refund, they threw numerous ppl off in the middle of the early morning in the middle of only god knows where.I am not familiar with Rocky Moutains, NC at all! Leaving us with no stay or alternative transportation. One of the people who also got kicked off was a parent with a small child. They were not open nor willing to work out something with us on perhaps catching another train or even helping to accommodate us on stay. As a result of this matter, I would never again get on an Amtrak train and I will see to it that I post this review on as many sites and social media platforms so that people can see how unethical Amtrak is to their customers. I am still awaiting for corporate to get back to me on this matter. Reserve#24DCFC Case#5730234"
685,trustpilot.com,I really am questioning my decision on traveling by train to NJ from NC. The customer service is horrible. They charged my card three times for tickets and when i tried to upgrade they wanted to charge me double the price for their system errors. I am hoping i don't catch co-vid because i seems they are overpacking trains.
686,trustpilot.com,Worst ever I'll never do it again . First of all went to Snacks to purchase they said cash only so about half the people on train had nothing and some going alot further than I was . The staff wasn't all that professional and rude to say the last they were running behind an hr not to mention we were also told to keep mask on and if we were eating we were to pull mask off take a bite of our food then put mask on and repeat until food finished HELLO THEIR IS A VIRUS GOING AROUND SO TO ASK US TO REPEADALY TO TOUCH OUR MASK AFTER EACH BITE OF OUR FOOD TO THEN TOUCH IT AGAIN TO PULL IT UP THE WHOLE TIME WERE EATING IS DISGUSTING AND AGAINST THE LAW NOT TO MENTION IF WE DIDNT ABIDE WE WOULD BE KICKED OFF . MY WHOLE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE WAS HORRIBLE NOT TO MENTON I COULDN'T PAY WITH CASH BUT STAFF WAS ABLE TO TAKE CASH FOR TIPS LOL HORRIBLE. I DO PLAN TO GO FURTHER ABOUT THIS
687,trustpilot.com,"My review has a lot to do with safety precautions.  Honestly if you are not fully vaccinated and a little nervous I am not sure you would feel safe.  I cannot get over how many passengers were not wearing masks and the crew not only did nothing about it but a few did not have their masks on.  The people at the Albany train station did not ask people to put on their masks and sat by and literally did nothing when someone asked a person to wear a mask and this person became very angry. They literally just watched and never called security.  Staff all seemed tired, grumpy and impatient with customers.  I have ridden the train many times and on a positive note the bathrooms were cleaner than in the past. But if people wearing masks are important to you this is not the time to take the train."
688,trustpilot.com,The Amtrak Travel insurance with the 3rd party company Allianz is a joke! Go ahead and cancel and they will put you thru hell to get a refund. So much paperwork and a note from a Dr if you are not felling well. Skip the insurance
689,trustpilot.com,Let me say first this review is about the train service and the worthless customer service Amtrak provides or should I say fails to provide. The stewards on the train both ways were excellent. We took the Amtrak autotrain in November 2020. I called and changed my reservation to come back home a day earlier due to a family emergency. Three hours into the trip the train broke down. They gave us no information on the train as to why we were stopped or how long it will take. We should of arrived in Virginia at 8:30 am but instead arrived at 5:00 pm. 8 1/2 hours later and right into the heart of rush hour traffic getting home. My 4 hour drive turned into a 6 hour drive. I contacted Amtrak the next day because I definitely feel we should of gotten some form of compensation for the extra 10 hours of my life that I’ll never get back. They responded immediately with an email saying they would look into it and get back to me within 30-60 days. In is now over 5 months and the absolutely worthless customer service has never gotten back to me and have also not answered two more emails I have sent. I will never use Amtrak again and I have told everyone I know who was considering it not to use them either. Amtrak customer service sucks
690,trustpilot.com,Recently made a Car Train reservation for an Amtrak special ticket price.  Price was advertised with no change fees.  Had to change the reservation date and was still charged an additional $335 fee (back up to the regular ticket price) to make the change.  That or cancellation fee to drop the reservation.  Caught between a rock and a hard place!  WE WILL NEVER USE Amtrak Again!
691,trustpilot.com,"Late leaving, rude employees, dirty cars, no cleaning in the middle of a pandemic, and late coming back.  I think that covers it.  Oh and they don't care because they're your only option."

693,trustpilot.com,"First I love train travel, I know that there can be delays, my wife and I traveled on the texas eagle, LA to Dallas, trip was late, cars were old and worn, but I can deal with that, what made it difficult was no dining car and the flexible dining experience, on the train you have no option and one dish I can't eat so I really had limited options. the new food option is terrible, bring back the dining car, you are going to bean count amtrak into history this way"
694,trustpilot.com,Train 449 from Pittsfield MA to Boston MA during Covid. We had a roomette to be by ourselves. Instead of stopping the train so that roomette and bedroom people could get on we had to go through two cars to get to our roomette car. We opted for this car and paid more so that we would not have any contact with other passengers. This needs to be fixed please. The ride was wonderful as I have taken it a LOT of times. This was my husbands first time and he loved it. The wifi worked great and we were able to connect both our computers and our phone to play music. The train conductor for our car was not present except for when we got on and when we got off. How I sadly miss Curtis that was always on this line He passed away just two weeks after his retirement.
695,trustpilot.com,So I’m heading back to DC from Penn Station @Amtrak Acela 2253While most of the train is empty I’m seated in the back of a man who keeps coughing NON STOP. I asked the conductor what can we do and in return he caught a huge attitude and said “you’ll  be “ok”  because the back of the seat is enough and walked off... why be so rude!? We are in a middle of a pandemic 😷 yet his response is basically to “fffkk  off ” is how i took it. I refuse to believe some people are this way and are employed with a company like @Amtrak 😡
696,trustpilot.com,"For me Amtrak is a nice way to travel and see parts of the county that you cannot see from a plane, car, bus or bike. Many place to explore. Big towns, small towns and those towns in between. Ride the train and ride the nostalgia!"
697,trustpilot.com,Safest way to travel during COVID - have had to take 4 overnight trains in the last 3 months and I'm still COVID-free.
698,trustpilot.com,"We travelled in train # 6 from Nebraska to Illinois. The train was 1 hour late, so it went faster tokeep on schedule. I did not enjoy it. Previously, train had gone smoothly. Another was that there were more passangers and I thought that they would put seats farther apart due to COVID 19. In fact, there were far more passangers in this trip than other we took last year. This is probably die to the fact that trains do not run every day, but 3 times a week only.  Another thing was that the passanger next to our seats was without shoes and he would lay with his feet out and it was very uncomfortable for us.  Finally, bathrooms were dirty. I did not feel comfortable. So I would like Amtrak to not just say it, but do something about these issues. I think that costumers deserve a better service."
699,trustpilot.com,The experience was ok for a first timer but the food expensive and the some of the workers are rude n not good and as for a diabetic who didn’t know much and didn’t have my card or cash sucked bc I had slick remarks towards me and this was amtrack empire building train
700,trustpilot.com,"I am currently riding Amtrak train from LA to Portland. 1st of all there is absolutely no social distancing going on in here as every seat is filled up on this one car (#13)...Seems like the conductor's placed everyone on this one damn car to make their job easier! Since the trains are only leaving 3 days a week and riding at 50% compacity there is no way none of this should be going on!! Passengers are coughing, not wearing their mask and to top it off theirs a crazy lady sitting across from me filming people and cussing people out! Several passengers have went to the conductor's about her crazy behavior but not one has come to address it!! She nearly got assaulted by another passenger for using hate speech toward them. This is completely unacceptable & insane! it is 2:30 am and while the conductor's are off sleeping somewhere we can't get any! Bunch of lazy workers and the ridership sucks. Would have been better off walking!! Screw Amtrak and it's dirty filthy trains!!!!!"
701,trustpilot.com,"I am currently on this train; Texas Eagle. They want me to wear a mask 24/7, but they don't do temp checks or ask boarding passengers any questions. They don't search bags. I understand wearing a mask for when you are up and about, but when we are sitting in one spot for 24+ hours, we should be able to take them off. They don't clean the trains; found trash and old orange rinds in the cup holder. My advice....plane tickets are as cheap if not cheaper....fly to and from...so you only have to wear the mask for a few hours."
702,trustpilot.com,"I’ve been using Amtrak for the past 3 years to go to Orlando Florida from New York City and back. Before I would rate it alright because most of time it will get delayed along the way to the destination, but won’t get there too late or even on time sometimes. However one year there was a huge delay that we stayed in a station in Georgia for 2 hours and just at a stand still on the tracks for 3 hours and got 4 hours late to our destination. But this year, will be my last and final year traveling this way. My item was literally stolen when I got out of my seat to the cafe car for less than 5 minutes. They can at least add cameras somewhere. Before I used to leave items out all the time, but this time I guess someone lost their dignity and decided to steal a charger."
703,trustpilot.com,"Overall, Amtrak offers mid-range accommodations for a basic train ticket. Mask coverings aren’t even worn by half of the passengers if they just “don’t feel like it”. One of my major complaints is timing. There are certain trains that have no other running times and those times are in the middle of the night. Mind you, when I say middle of the night, you’re looking at 12:00 am to 1:00 am. Sometimes you can get a decent time, but only in bigger cities. I think this entire concept is ridiculous as it makes all passengers who need to get to certain places, have to travel at horrendous times. What is worse is that when you schedule these, they make sure you can’t refund them for money to buy bus tickets or anything far more convenient. I think service is okay, but scheduling needs to be massively adjusted. If it is a COVID issue, you should have planned for this 6 months ago when this all first started. Think about your customers and their needs before you put your trains first."
704,trustpilot.com,My sister and I took Amtrak round trip from Syracuse NY to Niagara Falls NY.It was a very nice experience.We never took amtrak before.I was very impressed.The people were very nice and the train was very comfortable.I cant wait to go again!
705,trustpilot.com,"Simple trips never work out with these guys.I take the train from Boston to Maine quite frequently, the last 6 times I've used the train it has been upwards of an hour+ late due to outdated technology and ""signal errors"". It almost seems like they should have been using the quarantine time to renovate their systems and technology, instead of making a 3 hour train ride into a 4-5 hour trip. They don't respect your time, so don't show them the business until they get their act together."
706,trustpilot.com,"I purchased a trip from LA to the Grand Canyon for myself, a Senior, and a young granddaughter. The trip involved 2 stages by Amtrak and 2 by bus. Found out the week before that 1 of the buses was no longer running and that I'd need to get myself from the Amtrak depot in Flagstaff into the Park. Had I not found out on my own, I'd have been left stranded at 4am. They offered me NO refund, but did offer the name of a taxi company (and I'd already paid for the bus leg). I phoned, emailed, phoned, emailed and finally turned it over to my C/c company who refunded all of my money. I frequently travel with Amtrak, and will continue to do so, but will NEVER book another trip with their package tour partner, Yankee Leisure."
707,trustpilot.com,"I am currently going through an absolute nightmare with Amtrak.My Wife and I had planned a cross-country trip for our 25th Anniversary. Purchase in March for September 2020. I put the deposit down with our debit card, then immediately removed/changed to our CC to add additional trip protection etc. as well as purchasing their own travel protection plan.By June we realized it would be in our best interest to cancel this trip until things may or might settle down with Covid-19. I called and canceled and figured that was that.Yesterday afternoon they wiped out our checking account and over drafted us by thousands of dollars.They are now actually fighting us on this, saying they have no record of the cancellation. I said fine then cancel us now. They stated that we are not entitled to a refund. That we are only eligible for future travel vouchers. This is despite all of their advertising, emails and website stating that there will be ""No Hassles Refunds with no fees"" for all trips booked before April 20th due to Covi-19.  I have spoken with several agents who are telling me that they never give money back, only travel vouchers. We currently filing a dispute with our credit union as we have run out of options. We currently can not pay our bills, and we have been robbed of any alternative vacation plans as we have absolutely no intention of traveling with Amtrak ever! Theives and Liars!"
708,trustpilot.com,I booked my auto train trip from Sanford FL to Lorton VA and back for our annual family vacation. This was the first and last trip I will ever take. I had a roomete and my son went with me. I could not sleep because of the shaking and the constant train horn. We where delayed at first because of a software glitch. The trip had many offensive smells. The urine smell of the bedding was totally avoidable if they had proper cleaning services. There was a pass by a landfill that took a while and a paper manufacturing plant. I was initially told I could cancel my trip anytime and when I tried to cancel the return they wouldn't.  I have a complaint filed with my bank against them. No matter what happens I am not getting on that train and will happily drive home. To top it all off they removed a Covid positive employee at the Lorton station.

I can read and see every detail like it’s broad daylight and am now on the third and final train.

Never take this companies trains, employees are good people but this company just doesn’t care.  Another passenger even joked and said they felt like they were in a mobile jail and they’re right, going 8 hour stretches without fresh air during a pandemic really shows you care Amtrak nice work.  All I know is thank goodness for cancel culture because Amtrak is long overdue"
710,trustpilot.com,First off when the city was closed from riots they could give me no information and told me it to try to go through the national guard to get to my train. after I've been on the phone with the police department saying if I came down to Cleveland I would be arrested so therefore I called back again they could not give me any information so I rescheduled my train for 10 days out because I didn't know what else to do and the lady on the other side of the phone for your company was no help at all and very rude. so finally my day comes up again and I make it to the train station and because I'm moving to Florida and have so much baggage they give me attitude right away is her freaking out. so I pack everything up a separate everything and the price for the shipping was way off from what the lady told me beforehand like a buy $100 o they do not take cash right now so there was no way for me to pay because all I had was Cash. A lady I did not know how do you use her credit card to pay for my luggage check and I gave her the money. Thank God a stranger was there to help me because your company was no help at all. Sono I am sitting in the streets of Cleveland with all my carry-on luggage because the Amtrak station closes it doesn't open till midnight so now I'm sitting in the middle of Cleveland where I know no one and have nowhere to go and I'm sitting on the streets after $800 Amtrak ticket. This is the absolute worst travel and experience I have had between uninformed mative information of the riots and how to deal with it to the nobody told me cash only or a credit cards only and leave me stuck here in the city where I know no one and have nowhere to go and I haven't even made it on the train yet I mean what is going to be my experience getting on the train because it has been horrible so far horrible all I want to do is go home and you're making it almost impossible and just keep taking my money. I couldn't even sit in the parking lot and wait for the train station the open they literally made me leave the ground with all of my carry-on luggage and go into the streets of Cleveland where I know no one and have nowhere to go. If this is how you treat your customers that pay well to travel well I hate to see how you treat your customers that buy the lower rate tickets it must be horrible because your policies almost make it impossible to travel and make it a very difficult experience. Which is not what you want after dropping so much money to move the Florida and using Amtrak cuz it was recommended because of the shipping fees were supposed to be lower and here I am having my stuff is with a stranger and I don't know I gave it away she's supposed to mail me a couple of boxes back I don't know if she will who knows she just made out if she didn't. And I'm stuck here all day until midnight when the train station opens again and the streets of Cleveland like a homeless person after paid $800 for all my check baggage . I am at a loss of words and your company is really needs to go over their policies because you made my travel and experience terrible I've cried several times this is a nightmare all I want to do is go home and here I am on the streets like a homeless person with all my carry-on luggage wondering how I'm going to make it back to the strain tasting at midnight because I've already paid $40 for a ride from Lodi to Cleveland to catch my train last nighr. this is how you treat your customers you throw them out of the streets like a homeless person while they're waiting on a train that you forced the person to miss because you would not take her cash. you really need to review your company policies and talk to your employees of how to handle them a little bit better when you're telling someone they have to give up more of what they own and they don't like you and they only take a credit card and they won't take your money and they have no other advice for you and they tell you nothing. Amtrak is horrible I will never travel aga
711,trustpilot.com,Terrible. Overpriced. There’s nothing else to it. It’s just bad. Just shy of a really bad score because the staff was friendly. 60 bucks per person from NYC to Poughkeepsie is ridiculous.
712,trustpilot.com,"Terrible customer service. I submitted a request for a refund on 4/1/20. The woman who took my call gathered all my information and didn't submit my refund request. I called again a couple of weeks later because I didn't get my refund and a woman with the same name, said that the first woman didn't submit my refund request. She gather again all my information and said for me to wait for two weeks to get my refund. I waited for three weeks, no refund. I called again and another woman tells me that a refund was issued on 5/20 and I should call again at the end of the week if I didn't get it. Well, I didn't get my refund. I called again and now another woman is telling me that my bank didn't say if it will accept the refund. That sounded very odd. I never heard of a Bank not accepting refunds into their clients' accounts.  She suggested for me to call my Bank. I did it. Sure enough, my bank said that they don't hold on refunds to be credited into their client's accounts. I called Amtrak again and told them what my bank said. The only thing that man that answered this time could say is that accounts payable is looking into it and I should call back on Wednesday. So, I don't have my refund as of today. It is clear that someone or some people drop the ball and they are not handling this well. The supervisor didn't even talk to me to let me know that she/he personally will take care of it. Perhaps s/he doesn't really care. All this is not even mentioning the long wait to get to talk to someone or while I was waiting for them to ""solve"" my problem. If anyone knows who should I talk to so I can actually be heard? I feel that that they are passing me around from one customer assistant to another hoping that I will get tired and not call back to get my refund."
713,trustpilot.com,Brilliant company! I live in UK and bought return tickets from NYC-BostonWhole trip cancelled due to Covid 19.Phoned them and they refunded straight away.

715,trustpilot.com,I tried to modify my reservation today on Amtrak. I was lead to believe I would be able to change my reservation without penalty thru May 31st. That was not the case. I have been an Amtrak rider for many years. Recently they offered a buy one ride and get a companion free. I booked my train for my grandsons birthday. Obviously we are not able to travel now. We were traveling to CT thru NY so !! This is a pandemic!! I was told they would not honor the offer and we would have to pay the difference in our fee. This is in my opinion poor business! Shame on you Amtrak !! Do the right thing !! Honor your offers to your customers.
716,trustpilot.com,"I'm sure Amtrak works fine when everything else is fine, but when there is an emergency they are unresponsive and not helpful. For international visitors it is pretty much impossible to get in contact with Amtrak. I wrote them about a month ago regarding the US border closing and the possibility of getting a refund for my ticket. I still haven't heard back from them.They did send a general notice saying that people were advised not to leave NY etc. which again should call for some kind of refund when you bought a ticket out of NY, but apparently not.I can understand that this is a difficult situation, but you still need to be there for your costumers.In the hopes that Amtrak will at least improve their means of communication in the future.--In the end going through social media helped. Help was quick here."

718,trustpilot.com,"March 12, 2020Train 19Anniston, AL to Hattiesburg, MSI had never taken a passenger train before so I decided to do it for fun.  It's awful.  The train kept having issue after issue.   As of writing this, we are still traveling.  Currently three hours late on a six hour trip.............   I fully expect the amount of time we are behind schedule will only increase since it has constantly this whole trip. They make announcements sometimes but you cant hear them over everyone playing their phones loudly or just generally trying to over talk each other.  The only reason I was able to coordinate my time of arrival was their website.  Not the best website but their ""how late is your train"" part works depressingly well.I would not recommend.  There was nothing enjoyable about it.  It would have cost only slightly more to drive a rental one way and I would be home by now."
719,trustpilot.com,"Terrible, stressful, unhelpful pretty much sums it up. There were no windows at a major train hub and only one kiosk which had a line and didn’t work. An Amtrak worker told all 30 of us to call 1-800-USARAIL to get some code. After being on hold for an hour and nearly missing our train, the code didn’t work anyway. Really a terrible and inefficient system."
720,trustpilot.com,I take Amtrak frequently and most of the time it is a good trip. A highly recommend the Northeast Corridor.👍🏼  Some staff are rude but most are pretty nice people. I will definitely take Amtrak again. Because what other options are there in the USA for train travel?

And if you think racism goes only one way you’re wrong. now i’m white and the representative made it clear that was personal. not only she informed me that the 10:20 train (3h later) was sold out and there where no seats, but after i got a refund and asked what’s the next train available she said 10:20 and she can no longer assist me because i asked for a refund. she starting gesticulating how she’s so upset and when i asked to talk to her manger she stood up and put a closed panel in front of the window. i’m wandering if all amtrack employees are MENTAL! of course a manager was able to help right away."

I was taking the route from Union Station to LA to San Luis Obispo. I am taking the time to write the review of the staff including the food cart gentleman. The staff is always there to assist. The train is quiet. Easy to navigate on. And very enjoyable."
723,trustpilot.com,"Last weekend my husband and I traveled to New Rochelle and he left his cpap machine on the train. We initially could not reach anyone to assist us to locate it. The next morning, Eric Sullivan from the New Haven, CT station called me to let me know it was found. He worked with me to figure out the best way to ship it to our home. The process of return was simple and it even arrived a day before we were quoted. I appreciate Eric's attention to detail and willingness to walk us to the steps to get this much-needed piece of medical equipment returned."
724,trustpilot.com,"There is a Quiet Zone in the town where I live.  The Amtrak trains regularly blow their horns in this quiet zone.  First negative.  When I wrote to tell them about this the customer service representative obviously did not read my comment and sent back a canned PSA about how they are allowed to sound X distance from the crossings.  Read what I wrote, don't respond to what you think I wrote.  Negative two."

726,trustpilot.com,I love traveling on Amtrak and have been on nearly every route over the years. My first trip I packed a book but I was so busy enjoying the scenery that I never really read it. Since Amtrak doesn't own the rails they travel on I always allow for them to be majorly late if they get hung up by freight traffic. I always feel safer traveling by train. It's too bad that they don't get adequate funding by Congress. They have to constantly make cuts year after year to try to become profitable but don't think any national railroad in the world is profitable. That's why Amtrak was formed- the freights got out of the passenger business because they were losing money. After 9/11 Amtrak and the bus was the only way to travel and I wish Congress wouldn't forget this. The lack of funding has had a bad effect on the food service and of course the equipment is way too old.
727,trustpilot.com,"Review is for Chicago to dc 7 Jan 2020.  This is my last time. It’s that bad. Caress hot as hey, I kept having to get up and go to the observatory car to cool off. Nasty snack bar I got scolded for setting my cape on the counter cuz of the food and all. So I sit down to eat my nasty bagel and the dude starts staying cleaner while I’m eating.  They have no refrigerator for use nor microwaves so you have only eat cold food. The crew for the most part have been good but they got their rude puppies"
728,trustpilot.com,I purchased an Amtrack ticket from Philadelphia to west palm beach. We used a Amtrack employee to book our trip . The employee did not tell us that there were two trains one that stops in Tampa out of the way and another that does not stop in Tampa. The one I took  stopped in Tampa . When it stopped in Washington DC instead of picking up the extra engine  which was protocol according to the staff on the train it only picked up one engine . This engine broke down in Virginia for over 6 hours. The conductor told me that two of those hours were spent figuring out what to do . They should have a plan in place .  They didn’t infirm us exactly our new time of arrival .to our destination.  They had one attendant on the train for food and he took breaks close to meal times for the  food car . So everyone had to stand in a long line to purchase food and drink. Which involved you be subjected to the coach people who were drunk half of them.  Not behaving . The food service   Train was taken away so your stuck for over 24 hours eating garbage like hot dogs . They should have separate food for sleeper cars like they do  for the  auto train. People don’t eat garbage food like that they want healthy food salads and fresh fruit . I luckily packed my own food  I had read a review about the food before leaving. Then it happened the last 8 hours  the smell of poop coming thru the vents . I find out in coach all the toilets were over flowing and it was a hot mess in the coach car . They should of been cleaned at one of the stops . I was lucky I had a sleeper bed room  with my own bath room. Which I locked and drew the curtains for my safety . The attendant was non existent and told me not to wake her in the morning because she sleeps late . Apparently she didn’t sleep enough because she was tired and should of been relieved from her job . Amtrack could have done something for the sleeper people moved us to a bus in Orlando so that we could of had our  vacation day back . Nope they carried us all to Tampa and we had no idea we were even going to Tampa most of us were not informed. So that we got in at 11:40 instead of four in the afternoon .  I won’t get on a smelly gross Amtrack long distance ever again !!! The service was awful and the people scary and the train smells like bowl movements. They can’t handle a engine failure . They don’t make it right . They could help you get off the train and find alternative transportation so you don’t loose your car rental and  Destroy your vacation . Never ever will I go any further then four hours with Amtrak Fly don’t train it ! Rent a car drive down it’s much faster then getting in the train to Florida. Amtrak should not be allowed to travel over night and not provide descent meals. Airplanes provide meals when it’s overnight . How can you have people waiting in long lines at meal times buying hot dogs for two days . It’s nuts. You lost your charm taking away the dinning car. Your only a a moving  bathroom on wheels on a track being pulled by broken down rusty engine cars . No one should have to smell poop for eight hours . Fly people fly !!!  A refund wouldn’t even be pay back for this.  I want Amtrak to be looked at by the government for how they treat people and how they treat their employees.
729,trustpilot.com,"Avoid AmtrakTerrible service! Purchased tickets for the 26th December on the 24th December. On collecting my tickets, my husband and I noticed the date was carded for the 24th December, however, the agent (at Penn Station) assured us it would be viable. On the 26th December, my husband and I (both tourists) checked in our baggage and boarded our cabin. However, upon settling in, the attendant informed us that our tickets were invalid due to the date! After conversing with the conductor, it was determined that we would have to pay for new seats or vacate the train at another location. After conversing with an agent from support about our issue, he stated that we would be unable to get a refund and have to purchase new tickets ro remain on the train. Amtrak needs to revisit the competency of their employees as it can place alot of persons in trouble and danger. As such, I will never recommend or use their service in the future."

731,trustpilot.com,"The Amrak is the most unreliable, inconsistent, and biggest joke of transportation I have come to find and I am a student in Chicago that uses public transportation as a part of my daily routine. Never take the amtrak train if you are on a schedule. I think its absurd especially in this day and age, for something used by numerous individuals for travel, to be so unreliable and inconsiderate of schedules. I support the amtrak company, and I buy a ticket from them at least once a month, and never once have I arrived to my destination on time, or even close to the time I was supposed to arrive. I support this company because there is no other option, and I believe that to be the reason that your staff and procedure does not cater to amtrak customers in an appropriate way. You guys KNOW you are one of the only affordable options for people, especially when traveling shorter distances."

But after using them this past week, I come to believe that they just don't care about their customers. Not only did they change my times on my departure date not once but twice!! Then the day that I left from Ann Arbor to go to Kalamazoo, MI they train was 30 minutes late which made me late & inconvenienced the person that was picking me up in Kalamazoo.Then on the returned date leaving Kalamazoo, the train was once again 30 minutes late. Then every stop after that, they would stay like 10 min. or more longer which then in turn took longer to return to Ann Arbor. This in turned made me 30 minutes late getting to work. I am seriously ticked off at Amtrak for making my trip very unpleasant."
735,trustpilot.com,The Amtrak cancellation policy in practice is different than stated on their Website.  The 25% penalty on sleeping car reservation should apply only to that segment of a multi-segment trip.  Instead they apply it to the whole trip.  I would love to travel by train but wish that our nation's passenger rail system was in more capable hands.

Twyla came on the phone dry as a bone and rude as a Bully!! Long Story short, (well not so short, 43 minutes & 4 seconds), Twyla made an attempt to verify my information and said Amtrak didn't call me. Then she said the reason for the call was because I didn't pay for our trip!!! Then she wanted the CC# that I used.  Mind you I was called, so why, oh why, would I give out my CC#? I pulled up my Confirmation info and gave it to TWYLA she put me on hold then came back with the same info that was sent to my email.  Since I needed more information and TWYLA was soooo rude I asked to speak with someone in authority and a better attitude. Her response was that ""I had an attitude"".  My response was ""bring one get one"". I was wrong for my response. Two wrongs don't make a right.  Meanwhile, on my landline, I called Amtrak and talked to Hardenia.

743,trustpilot.com,"Several years ago (2015), my son and I took a look-see trip on the California Zephyr from Sacramento, CA to Grand Junction, CO. At Grand Junction we could get off at noon, have lunch in town (a delicious burger joint), and get on the West-bound train about 4 pm. We shared a roomette (overnight each way) so dining car meals were included and the food was good. Being the taller of us Ben got the lower bunk and I got the upper. It was pretty cramped if you are used moving your body during the night. We went during Winter so daylight was short, but there was a full moon and the weather was clear so even at midnight and beyond the dome car offered some spectacular views. The return from Grand Junction to Sacramento was an adventure most would rate as a disaster, whereas I found it exceedingly interesting and informative. The train we boarded was the one that had been stuck in a Midwest snow-drift for days. The food had been restocked in Denver, but plumbing was still frozen in some cars, and the crew was pretty grumpy. Most west bound passengers had decamped at Denver, so there were very few passengers. I figure that if you are going to ride Amtrak you have to be looking for adventure.So. I am planning a round trip adventure from Sacramento to Portland or Seattle (Coast Daylight/Starlight, then to Chicago on the Empire Builder, Chicago to New Orleans (City of New Orleans [Arlo Guthrie]),  then Sunset Limited from NOL to LAX, and LAX back to Sacramento. I expect this to be an adventure. I will not include my 40 year old son, so I will get the lower bunk. I will let you know how it turns out.John from Sacramento"

Some trains to FL are run in a rough, raw group of ol' conductors who talk like they don't give a damn.  Ask to change seats to spread out and get comfortable-- and an old guy might ask you ""why didn't you pay for a sleeper""....  rude and dumb reply (Booze?  Don't really care, but how about taking it down a notch if someone wants to sit somewhere without being next to the fat lady who talks the entire time on her cellphone?)Other conductors are really great. But all in all when the Wifi is down, it's like a concentration camp ride.  Everyone goes bananas.   Fix the Damn Wifi so it works every single time!!!  We pay through the nose, right?"

Our checked luggage was taken off the train in Topeka. We were told we had to go to Kansas City to pick it up. Ticket agent called Wednesday, November 16, 2022 letting us know at 1:30 am our luggage was in his office. He also stated if we didn't pick it up by Monday November 21, 2022 it would've went to Chicago and destroyed. 

We talked to customer relations Marion #4067 who let us know to fi!e a claim report.

We picked up the luggage Friday the 18th.

The train was for hours late getting to Williston ND I could deal with that, But the one thing I could not handle was I was eating and kept seeing clumps of dust falling down by my food. I looked up between the window and luggage storage above my seat where the light is located there was massive amounts of dust and other things. I the only time I have ever seen so much filth was in a condemned house. I had to wear my mask on the train just quit from inhaling the crap. I took pictures and a video of it.

I thought he exaggerated, but staying over to help him a while ago the horns are used often and they are louder than the tv on full volume. I have no idea how this is legal, and in these days of technology I have no idea why it is necessary. The have their own paths, nobody is surprised a train is active on train tracks. No need to alert their presence as it is there, but even further crossings have safety equipment. Trains can be tracked and communicate over multiple means. I don’t know much about trains, except they’re a great transportation option, but I doubt the horns serve any function other than alerts.

804,complaintsboard.com,"First of all, I'm NOT looking for something free. I know it's been way too long, and I should have said something sooner. I'm writing this complaint because a friend who is elderly and disabled (as am I) recently returned from a trip to Portland, OR, and says conditions have not changed.

In July of 2019, I traveled to Tucson, AZ (round trip). I won't elaborate on the trip to Los Angeles or the trip from there to Tucson. The discomfort I endured on those legs of the trip pale in comparison to the nightmare that was the trip from Los Angeles to my home town.

The train was filthy. I was traveling business class on the lower level (as I said, I am elderly and mobility impaired). Shortly after leaving Los Angeles, all of the restrooms in our car stopped working. For the remainder of my journey, I had to climb to the second level and go forward two cars to use the restroom. That trip, and the return to my seat were agony. Plus the fact that the restrooms in the other care were also filthy. I won't dwell on other disgusting aspects of my journey home. I can tell you that your trains are no longer Amtrak to me; they are Amtrash (Amcrap?)."

806,complaintsboard.com,"On the morning of 09/30/22, I was to catch the early train from Topeka and was notified via email it was running a little late. I called Amtrak customer service and got a rude/nasty girl who kept telling me the arrival in Topeka would be two hours late. All I wanted to know is if I would make my connection in Kansas City (Missouri River Runner) in time. She proclaimed ""I don't know what you want me to say - it's going to be 2 hours late"". I explained to her that the app said it was only 1 hour and 31 minutes late. She hatefully said ""nope, it's 2 hours late"". I hung up the phone then redialed the customer service number and got a nice young man who couldn't tell me a different answer...except that it was 2 hours late - but, he was nice. The app on my phone, however, said it would be 1 hour (now) 39 minutes late arriving in Topeka but only 55 minutes late arriving in Kansas City. He had no answer for that confusion...but, after his recommendation of canceling the two separate Kansas City and the Topeka trips and then rebooking them together, I did that and felt confident that I would make the River Runner in time since it was only 55 minutes late into KC. The train made up time and were assured over the train intercom ""not to worry, we would definitely make our connection"". We pulled into Union Station right alongside the train we were to transfer to, the Missouri River Runner. I was excited to know I would soon be on the next leg of my trip and on time. Soon after the announcement about us making the connection, we heard that we should all remain seated as they were going to hook up two more cars for the next leg of that particular trains trip. Then, as the train was not moving, we were told we were sitting there waiting on a cargo train to pass. That lasted about 10 minutes. Then we began to go in reverse. We hooked up one of the extra passenger cars...then the other. As the second car was being attached, the Missouri River Runner began to pull away from the station. Oh No! They left without me. Frustrated and one of the first people off the train, I spoke to an employee and said I missed my train (yes, it was literally just yards away from where I stood moving away quickly). He said, yes, we know there were several of you who were to board that train. I asked why we couldn't get off to get on that train. He said because it was not safe. I understand that, but we sat for 10 minutes waiting for a cargo train and we could have gotten off and been on the River Runner before it departed. He told me they radioed the River Runner and told them the situation then asked them to wait 10 minutes to which they were told ""No"". We had to be rebooked on the next train that left 8 hours later thus we had to hang around the station all day long to board our train. I missed a meeting, a visit/lunch with a friend, and had to rearrange a pick up in St. Louis for that night. There is also the matter that I booked Business Class on the AM train and there were no Business Class seats on the PM train. This frustrating day did not need to happen for us. These are just not good practices and I feel I should be compensated in some way for the poor decisions of Amtrak representatives that day. This makes me furious. And today I received a survey online about my trip. I filled it out. It was the poorest survey I've filled out for Amtrak. I've been happy with my service, ride, and comfort in the past. Not this time, Amtrak...not today."

He boarded the 2:12pm train from Seattle to Eugene yesterday, September 23rd and was approached by Amtrak employee while seated on the train and was forced to exit the train! He was stranded in Seattle and was mistreated, scared and deserves an apology, a refund along with compensation for pain and suffering.

813,complaintsboard.com,"I had purchased Amtrak Train Tickets on July 9, 2022, traveling to Pittsburgh on August 8, 2022 and returning back from Pittsburgh on August 19, 2022.

The terrible experience I had was when I was traveling to Pittsburgh, PA on August 8, 2022. The train was scheduled to be in Huntingdon, PA at 4:23 pm. It was not on time. It was closed to 4:45 pm when it arrived. In addition to this, they were no seats for me to sit on in the train. I had to walk from one Train car to another with the White male Conductor following me behind all the way to the last car like as if I was a Criminal because I am an African American woman with long hair. He harassed me for my Train ticket to scan it while I was standing with a heavy luggage, a Tote bag, and shopping bag. He was very inconsiderate. I had to stand from the time I entered the Train in Huntingdon, PA till the Train stopped at Atloona, PA for people to get off. The seat that I found was dirty and had food stains on it. I had to use my Hand Sanitizer and Face Tissue to wipe down the seat before sitting down.

Usually, when a Passenger enters the Train, the Conductor that collects or scans tickets, waits untill the Passenger is settled down in his/her seat or found a comfortable spot to stand before asking for Train ticket. This White man following behind all the way is unacceptable and disrespectful. I purchased my Train tickets and paid for them in full. Why should I be harrassed by a White man in the train because I am a woman? I called several times last saturday, August 20, 2022 and I was transferred to a called by service and I was hung up on. I had to call back again, only to be told that the Customer Relations doesn't open on Saturdays. That I should call back from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 8 pm.

821,complaintsboard.com,"This regarding Amktrak Vacation Reservation # : 599855

I called the Amtrak Rewards line to get our vacation put on my account.

The gentlemen I spoke to said there was a problem with the hyphen in my name, which we resolved quickly. Then he noticed that the other problem was that the sleeper cars on trans 2 and 6 (Southwest Chief and California Zephyr) for the reservation had been removed from the trains due to electrical issues. So he transferred me to Amtrak Vacations.

The gentleman I spoke to indicated that due to manpower shortages, the sleeper cars could not be manned for those trains on our dates, but then said they had a roomette on the Southwest Chief but only Coach on the Zephyr. Since he was not able to give us a bedroom, I had to cancel the rip.

We have lost the $678 we paid for the insurance and ended up Amtrak credit for $2407.70.

Here are my issues;

1. Why were we not notified that we would not have our accommodations?

2. What would have happened if I had not contacted Amtrak Rewards? Would we have arrived in Chicago and been put in a roomette or lower and in coach seats in Emeryville, CA?

3. Why the discrepancy in explanations? Electrical or manpower?

4. If all sleepers are being taken off, why is there a roomette available?

5. Why can I not get a full refund? What good is Amtrak credit if this is just going to happen again?"

Our train arrived in Flagstaff at 08.40am on 10 July, 12hours late. This disrupted our plans significantly as we were not able to use our hotel booked in Flagstaff at a cost of 266USD. We were not provided with any updates by rail staff or apology during the journey to know the status of the journey. We were unable to sleep during the delay as we did not know the estimated time of arrival and the tracker kept on changing the estimated time of arrival.We were not confident to continue the journey onto LA and hired a car. This decision was justified as the train from Flagstaff to LA arrived 4h late on 12 July which would have further disrupted our plans.We are therefore requesting a full refund for the 4 USA rail passes that we purchased due to the significant 12h delay and the additional expenses occurred. Vouchers would be unacceptable compensation as we are international travellers and will not be able to use them.We were really looking forward to the joy of travelling by train across the states and a full refund would go some way to redeeming this unfortunate experience.

Before we could go, COVID hit and everything was put on hold. A year later COVID started to settle down so I rebooked the trip. However, just before we could leave a Hurricane hit New Orleans and whipped out the track and the hotel where we were booked. Amtrack gave a voucher to hold until things settled down. I am now 3 years older and my body had deteriorated to a point to where it is hard to walk. So I decided I would just cancel the plan and get back my money. 

Over the past two months I have continuously called Amtrax only to wait on the line for up to 1 /12 hours at a time only to be transferred or put on hold and never answered.

831,complaintsboard.com,I am traveling on Amtrak surf liner coast train from Oceanside to Los Angeles. Went to food car to purchase wine and chips. Plastic cups were on counter in open so I took one. The counter person said I should not do that. I asked why and he became enraged saying because of covid. I said the cups are in the open with no sign? He then said I am not serving you. I then went to my seat and looked for conductor of the train. Miss K. Williams said she was the conductor and that she couldn’t do anything. She told me the food counter person name is Mark.

Dear AMTRAK:

This letter is in response to horrible service that we received on one of your trains we were on traveling to Delaware from Cary, NC on 7/10/22. We were on the train in route to see my sister in Dover, Delaware for an important family event. When we got to Wilmington we were going to get off and were at the doors but there was apparently an electrical shortage, and the doors did not open in Delaware. 

We had to travel all the way up to Philadelphia but to make matters worse on arrival in Philadelphia we asked a train ticket person what we should do and asked for assistance getting off the train. He was very abrupt, refused to help and started screaming at us. We were unable to get his badge number as he turned it around when we asked for it. We eventually were able to return to Wilmington but at this point we were hours late, missed the car picking us up and had to reschedule the car which cost us more money. This caused us to miss an important event at my sisters which we had spent money to attend. As a result of this horrible service we are requesting a full refund of tickets both coming and going. We returned on 7/14/22 from Delaware to Cary, NC. The other people traveling with me both of whom are senior citizens and disabled and who also received the bad service were Natalie Boone and Mildred Rice. The reservation number was 2E1F7F.

837,complaintsboard.com,"I booked a vacation package for 4 adults with Amtrak Vacations going for June 17 to June 24 going from Washington DC to Chicago and from Chicago to Seattle and San Francisco. Got to Union Station in Washington on 6/17 and learned that tickets were only available for 2 adults and the train was sold out. In order to make the connecting train on 6/18 from Chicago to Seattle, we had to drive 9 to 10 hours through the night to Chicago. I initially booked a bedroom car and a roomette but was later told that Amtrak took off the bedroom cars because it was short staffed and we could only have 2 roomettes. What we actually got was a roomette for 2 and coach for 2. We also saw that Amtrak was indeed running bedroom cars on the train. We finally got a roomette and bedroom car on the leg of the trip from Seattle to San Francisco. On 6/18, I was promised a refund to my credit card for the leg of trip from Washington, DC to Chicago as well as for the roomette that we did not get from Chicago to Seattle.

846,complaintsboard.com,"I am writing to file a complaint with Amtrak for services on 6/11 and 6/17. First, I was traveling with my sister who requires accessible seating, she travels with a wheelchair and a walker and I was traveling with my 14 year old son who is still very dependent. 

Upon boarding the 4:30 train at Philadelphia, it was packed. A woman traveling with her infant and companion had to leave the seats that were for my sister and a companion. I told my son to sit with my sister because I didn't want him on another cart by himself. Meanwhile, I had to search for a seat, but returned to my sister and son after not finding one close by. My sister opted to sit in her wheelchair from Philadelphia to Norfolk, Virginia.

While in Fredericksburg, Virginia, the conductor announced that he could no longer drive the train because he could not exceed 12 hours and that his relief was traveling from Richmond. We waited 45 minutes or so. We were supposed to arrive to my mother's who is recovering from a near death illness at 11:30pm. My brother who picked us up from the train station had his five year old daughter with him when we arrived after 1:15 AM. By the time we were situated and in bed it was 3:00am. My sister requires rest and meds and she took ill later that day.

Our return trip was just as crowded. People did not wear masks, some were coughing and families were separated. The wheelchair accessible bathroom was full of water/urine that I cleaned with gloves and my foot so my sister would not slip and fall. Even after cleaning, tissue was all over the floor. There were people who came around to collect trash but did not check the bathrooms.

It was pointless to collect tickets a second time since everyone was scattered. Passengers had to assist me in getting my sister off the train in her wheelchair because no one came and said anything to us about a ramp upon our sudden arrival to Philadelphia. We were afraid we would be stuck on the train. After everyone had boarded and de-boarded the train, my family and I were the only ones standing on the platform. The train had not left the station yet. Moments later, the conductor comes and says she was coming and there was only two of them.

Lastly, it has been two days since our return trip to Philadelphia and I tested positive for COVID today after showing symptoms yesterday, which I think was from the crowded unmasked train.

Sincerely,

Nayjuana Stephens"

My sister requires an aid for her mental and physical disabilities. I had to wipe the bathroom floor with my foot and gloves so she wouldn't slip and fall. Families and companions were separated because they were looking for seats. The conductor had to remain stationed in Fredericksburg, VA because he could not exceed 12 hours of driving the train."

857,complaintsboard.com,"Hi I AM VERY VERY UPSET the way Amtrak is running anymore, no courtesy, hateful rude people going up and down the isles and the trip I had back I thought I was going to die from heat. On May 30th my friend and I arrived in Houston at the train/bus station where we caught our bus back to Longview Texas.. We left Houston at 1:a5-1;15 and headed back to Longview. Before we got on we were told something very disturbing about our train and we were given a choice to make another reservation, only to find out we couldn't get that train until the 4th of June, Now how many people has the money to reschedule and stay that long. NOT ME not my friend that traveled with me, we both have jobs and are on disability plus I have had a liver transplant and didn't pack enough medication for me to stay that long. It would have cost an arm and a leg, to get another rental, hotel and whatever.. So we went, we had to sit in that train station till1:00 am and I tried to get a sleeper on the way back and they wanted 250 more on top of what I paid, that there was absolutely wrong with all we were going through already. Me having 27 surgeries, 7 on my neck, 3 lower back surgeries, liver transplant, spleen removed, elbow, 4 on my nasal which made it worse to breathe and the gentlemen behind the desk said Amtrak is not going to give anyone any accommodations, I have been with them to many years not to know this. Another issue. With as huge as y'all are and can't even have someone fix the AC unit but let someone have a stroke or die from Asthma or something. Shame on you guys.. I am so disgusted with this trip that I will be traveling another way from now on and I will tell everyone how we got treated while riding in no air. The last guy that came on board was very upset and told everyone to contact Amtrak when we could and complain. He brought big bags of ice and passed it around the only one who cared. Amtrak is huge and could have called someone to meet us at a train stop and fix that AC, I talked to several people who knows these trains and they threw a fit the way this was NOT handled but let us get sick and overheated. You honestly need to make this right because people depend on this transportation to get around and us that our disabled anyway can't handle this kind of stuff, I tried sitting in there to eat and the conductor said no, what a shame.. So we got in Springfield at around 1:30 - 1:45 Wed am and I got back home at 3:30 am and I am still not back to normal, I feel like I have been beaten with a bat and then hit by a mac truck, and I am not exaggerating one bit.. How would you handle this without complaining? Not very well. One very unhappy elderly lady here!"

I rode the 283 train today from Albany to Depew.

Can the toilets be filled with a citrus deodorant? Can anyone put a swiffer on the train to clean up urine on the floor? Can the tank be drained more regularly?

As we boarded the train in Miami a woman by the name of Fay Garner introduced herself and explained that she was our attendant for the trip and would be taking care of us. Shorltly after the train departed, she stopped by and took our lunch order and time we wished to be served. We ordered and asked for a 1:30 time. She dropped off our lunch at 2:00 and we never saw her again. As we were approaching Lakeland FL I pushed the call button twice to get information on where we would be exiting the train. She never responded. Another passenger in the same car was also trying to find how to exit when we came to Lakeland. The three of us then walked the length of our car and another trying to find help. Some how we ended up at the luggage compartment. The young lady in front of us yelled for help to get us off, we were told to return to our rooms and the attendant that was in luggage would come to us. Her name was Mrs Garner but not the attendant we has met befor. This second lady came and asked us who was our attendant. The train had now continued on with us still on the train. She brought back Fay Garner who told us she has mistakenly thought we were going to Tamps. They would take us back to Lakeland but it would be an hour and 30 mins. When asked why she did not answer our call she said she was in a meeting. My companion siad he has seen her taking to someone earlier. She said she was sorry. Well I told her I would be filing a complaint and she said if I did I might cost her her job. She obviously wasn't doing her hob to start with. Our tickets clearly stated Lakeland FL not Tampa and never saw her after lunch delivery.

871,complaintsboard.com,"Hello. I am calling in regard to uninhabitable sleeper cars on my round trip:

Details re: of the ticket are below. 

The problem: 

1. Occasional sewage smell in our sleeper car and constant sewage smell in our traveling companions' car on the way to Glenwood/

2. On the return trip — we traded with our companions so that they would not have to endure as much of a smell. Also, we thought they were just being overly sensitive. They were not. the smell was horrible. We complained to our porter, Mary, who showed us that she had been reporting the problem since APRIL 11 — but the systems stemming from one bathroom were inoperational.

3. At Denver, she managed to move us to the next train car, where the smell was more intermittent — it came whenever someone opened the doors between cars. 

It's unacceptable and dangerous to breathe sewage for 24 hours at a time — especially during a pandemic.

I was forced to cancel my upcoming NYC to Alexandria VA trip (C59C15) as Amtrak suddenly cancelled my train #195 without notice.

I did however receive a request to fill out COVID forms for travel at 3PM today but at no time was I informed the train was cancelled.

I was traveling to Alexandria VA for my aunt's funeral service nearby in Fort Myers with my elderly 83 yr old mother and had booked accommodations via Hotels.com for Sunday through Wednesday.

My mother cannot fly and Monday's departures would've had us arrive too late for the the service therefore I cancelled the entire trip.

Unfortunately, my hotel charged me one night's stay of $271.52 as I did not cancel by March 3, 2022 11:59PM. At what time did Amtrak cancel this train?

I find that Amtrak dropped the ball in not informing me in a timely enough fashion via email and/or mobile phone.

My train trip - Sacramento - Seattle - Vancouver - was booked and paid for in full on August 13, 2021, with departure date of MON OCT 4, and returning THURS OCT 14.
However, I broke my wrist on September 17, which required a surgery scheduled for Sept 29.

Alarmingly, I was informed by the ""customer service rep"" during that phone call that Amtrak was ""not going into Canada anymore."" However, a few days prior to my call, I had literally received via email all the travel documents from Sacramento to Vancouver, without any indication of the changes! The travel documents sent to me on September 20, 2021 included:
""DAY 3 SEATTLE TO VANCOUVER: Today, travel to the Amtrak station and journey to Vancouver, British Columbia. Sit back and relax on the scenic ride through the northwest! Pull into Vancouver and travel to your hotel to check-in and drop your luggage then use your included admission to the Vancouver Lookout. (Overnight in Vancouver)""
The ""customer service"" rep had no idea why I received those documents and was rather dismissive, ""Oh, well, I don't know who booked you but we don't go there anymore…. there's nothing I can do.""
What would I have done upon my arrival to Seattle without knowing at that time that there was NO AMTRAK bus into Canada as scheduled? 
I cancelled the itinerary from Sacramento to Seattle and agreed to the voucher form of the ""refund"" but kept the various reservations in Vancouver/BC to see if I could find another mode of transportation into Canada. 
Because I had planned the trip months earlier, and made arrangements to take time off work, get my passport, arrange pet/house sitting etc. I immediately called Air Canada to see if I could get a flight into Canada. They were accepting passengers for flights to Vancouver from CA - passengers were required to be vaccinated (I am) and tested 72 hours prior to travel (I did). 
However, on the day of my trip THURS OCT 7 to Vancouver, as I prepared to board my flight, I was informed I made a mistake with the timing of the COVID test i.e. the covid test I took was timed for the first leg of the plane trip on THURS OCT 7 from Sacramento (1045 am) not the second leg on the same day from LA to Vancouver (1245 pm). I was unable to get on the plan because I was informed that the test was 74 hours old verses 72 hours old. 
I immediately took another COVID test at the airport on THURS OCT 7, booked another flight to Canada for FRI OCT 8, and called Amtrak to cancel the hotel and the events scheduled for THURS OCT 7. I was told that because I was not within the 24 hour cancellation policy for the hotel, I would not receive a refund, but the cost of the events would be refunded as a voucher. 
The results of the COVID test I took on THURS OCT 7 did not come back in time for me to travel to Canada on FRI OCT 8, so I called Amtrak again to cancel the hotels in Vancouver and BC (six nights) and the events - the ferry, and exploding Victoria, the trip to BC etc. 
At that time, I was informed I would not be able to get any refund or voucher for the Vancouver/BC part of the trip (to include the hotels reservation for the 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14) because I was in the ""penalty phase."" So, the day before on THURS OCT 7 I was told I could cancel the hotel reservations if I did so within 24 hours prior to arrival but the next day on FRI OCT 8 I was told I COULD not do so? 
I was well within the time frame to cancel the hotel reservations (which was confirmed by the hotel staff in Canada when I called them On FRII Oct 8) for the Sat OCT 9, Sun OCT 10, Mon OCT 11, Tues OCT 12, Wed OCT 13 and Thurs OCT 14.
I have attempted to resolve the issue to no avail: Per email on Jan 3, 2022 and Oct 12, 2021 from Karen M. ""Customer Care Specialist"" with ""Yankee Leisure Group"" ""Good Afternoon Angela, For this reservation you did not have any trip protection, so in this case there is nothing we can do in regards to refunding or creating credits. I would advise to file through a 3rd party insurance company if you have one.""
What is most egregious about this issue is that the Amtrak customer is the only one in this equation who is suffering any consequences for AMTRAK's ineptitude! A company that emails travel vouchers for transportation into a country where AMTRAK had decided to NOT provide transportation is shockingly inept. The fact that it was only by chance that I was informed of this prior to travel is misconduct. 
Because of AMTRAKs misconduct, a sequence of unfortunate events unfolded, and I appear to be the only one who will bear the consequences. 
Again, AMTRAK‘s misconduct is the precipitant to my having to scramble to get transportation for my long planned ""train travel"" vacation; add to this, in the time of the COVID pandemic, the misery of air travel (which is why I choose the train), since no one is completely sure about the ""timing"" of the test results as evidenced by me joining a group of other passengers who didn't board the plane to Vancouver on Oct 7 due to ""issues"" with the COVID test. 
In the last ten years, I have travelled on Amtrak down to San Francisco and back to Sacramento at least 40 times. I've convinced my family and friends to join me numerous times and have been an ambassador for train travel. 
Rest assured, if I am not provided a full refund of $2232.54 from Amtrak for this disaster that Amtrak set into motion, my train travel will not be deterred. However, I will share my story with every single person I meet on the train, and to every single person I talk to about travelling by train.

The train did not arrive in Sanford FL on December 22, 2021 until 5:10pm .
9 hours LATE. As a result, a missed several scheduled appointments on December 22. I would have made other travel arrangements if I knew it was going to be SO LATE.

The reason given for being so late was engine problems. After going about 600 yards. The train stopped and went backwards to the station for engine repairs. Then the train had to made numerous stops for train traffic and to change train personnel. The train personnel had to be changed to due federal law. Passengers were told they could not work more than 24 hours. These problems were within amtrack's control. It was not unreasonably late due to weather.

892,complaintsboard.com,"Van Nuys: I told Amtrak agent Monique, someone not wearing a mask. She said it was not her job to address the person, if it bothered me, I should move away and tell her myself. Lady refused and was rude.

Two other passengers, Carrie and Robin, also saw the exchange. I told Monique that when I was at the Oceanside station on 12/23/21, the agent DID tell unmasked people to leave. Monique said the lady was a ""regular"", and was OK (I think she came to the station from the Bakersfield Bus).

Upon boarding train 770 on 12/27/71, Carrie, Robin and I deliberately sat in a different car to avoid her. Sometime south of L.A. a conductor moved the lady to our car, because there had been many complaints about her not wearing a mask in the other car. We told the conductor we didn't want her in out car, and she (named Yasmine) said then WE should move! We were senior citizens, comfortable in out seats, but Yasmine made all three of us move to accommodate the lady breaking the mask rules.

Mask rules are clearly posted at the stations and aboard the trains. And, at each stop an announcement is made that masks are required, and that failure to comply can result in removing the person from the train, and possibly being banned from future AMTRAK travel.

We asked the conductor (Yasmine) to remove the lady from the train, but she refused."

895,complaintsboard.com,"The video with the instigator, a black male conductor, and a couple other videos, appear to be too large a file, they are not uploading. I will cut a brief clip from one to upload so you can identify the culprit who made unlawful and improper racial comments as well as refused me passage DESPITE ALL OF AMTRAK's published policies, months of ridership without incident, and federal law... He even admits he never even looked at the ticket. He simply checked the itinerary afterward to see who had a ticket, hadn't boarded, and passed that info to the next conductor. See that video, I have 8 original videos altogether.

Following is the same recap shared with attorneys currently considering my claim against Amtrak with the video evidence. I have several videos, all taken from public ingress/egress easements where there is no legal right to any expectation of privacy documenting this misconduct, which I began to document after multiple racism implying comments by the initial (black) conductor indicating I was unwelcome on the basis of his personal views on skin color and current politics:

***********************************************************************
Today I'm in a lot of pain still, added to by a sleepless night due to seizures related to health issues, some of which by ALL guidelines, CDC included, exempt me from the ""mandates, "" even for travel purposes a la air or train or other federally regulated travel. Mention as related to additional need, separate from being deprived of work here in CA over the rampant paranoid delusions and responses thereto over the covid narratives.

For Months I have travelled across state lines, as well as from my home in Orange County, CA to San Diego, CA for social as well as odd job purposes related to my artwork and trying to build a business I won't have to rely on politics sensitive enterprises. In almost all cases for the past year I have used Amtrak (best network and accessibility points for my purposes.

Last night, Dec. 4th, I was denied access to an Amtrak train by a rabid (black) racist conductor. He made several insulting and false comments regarding my ""entitled"" status and person, implying race, and that they were why I would not be allowed on not only his, but any Amtrak train. When he realized I was recording him with my cell phone, he changed his narrative to ""I/we (who is ""we""?!?) no longer feel safe with you unmasked in our presence"" followed up by ""I/we no longer feel safe with you on any train."" Amtrak allows conductors final say on who is allowed or not on a train it turns out. Some consult the engineer, most do not, in my experience.

This same person (name badge on one of the videos but I'm not looking at it, no prior interactions ever I know of) left me, dressed for a daylight trip for a quick side job, with an immediate daytime turnaround back home, all to be completed before dark, stranded at the station in San Diego (thank God it was there and not Alaska!) for the next 3 hours, underdressed for the weather as my task was indoors and as I said both trips and work were all to be completed during daylight hours, with me arriving home near or just after dark. Instead, I was left underdressed and without recourse for several hours after dark awaiting the next scheduled train on that route. No further information or directions were provided to me, only that I would have to catch another train, he wasn't letting me ride under any other circumstances. He also made a number of surreptitious comments, many I did not catch, to a number of other black employees of Amtrak, including one who became extremely hostile towards me henceforth. It was an open comment that had sparked my belief that I needed to film and record his behavior in the first place. Another black female, initially hostile, after further interaction with me, relaxed and abandoned her hostility entire. At no time did I act inappropriate, though I had informed and maintained that for health reasons I was ADA exempt and had travelled that very morning, and for the past 6 months (closer to a year total) on numerous Amtrak lines and routes without any trouble whatsoever ever, without ever wearing a mask, and being exempt under their policy and all guidelines (regardless if one feels the mandates are lawful or not). This is fact. I can produce receipts/ticket confirmations by email of numerous trips. Not all, but most are emailed to me due to how I book. NEVER in a year has a single Amtrak staff informed me of a different process for booking if an exemption is claimed or to be provided. On two prior occasions a conductor had commented that there ""should be"" a way to comment that when a ticket is booked so that the conductor is notified when they scan the ticket so no conversation is even necessary - but when you book there is not, nor is ANY indication that it is even possible outside one's personal knowledge and assertion of rights that it is possible to be exempted from their policy and ""mandate."" None whatsoever, and no opportunity to append any note or comment on your reservation whatsoever.

This same black employee contacted, after the train departed and we parted ways, the platform staff (a thenceforth militantly hostile black female) and the conductors on the train scheduled after him, givign them my name and unknown details that resulted in their first exchange, on the subsequent train, even before they viewed my ticket to ask ""is he going to behave this time."" That was the only portion I could overhear. There was more said. One staff was mixed black and the other white. The mixed deferred to the white, but ultimately started repeating a falsity to justify them leaving me behind again, after offering me a false ""compromise"" that they then refused to perform 100% without provocation, also captured on video. The mixed black began repeating the ""magic words"" ""at this point I don't feel safe with him being on board without a mask on as we do, "" despite the fact her mask was not only useless regardless but was not worn to cover her nose at the time, a fact I comment on in my video when she start that false narrative.

The second conductor (the white lady) admits that the former conductor relayed my name to her with a warning to keep me off the train and she wasn't going to side with me over her coworker, regardless of my actual behavior not conforming with whatever he reported, the details of which she would not divulge.

Station staff disagreed with the entire events but stated they had no authority over the conductor. They assured me it was being written up and provided for action when supervisors were around again Monday, but could take no action to remedy or counteract the rogue conductor's misinformation and misconduct that night. Though there was another train that night, I would be stranded, still miles from home, at the far end regardless after the 1st train I was denied passage upon. Ultimately, that staff offered to refund my ticket and helped find an alternative in the right direction, though her information was incomplete and the route expected was not available at that hour on any weekend so I was stranded about midway between San Diego where these incidents occurred and my home. My only option from that midpoint on was a much more expensive Lyft ride home, which ultimately added to my health problems as I am allergic to chemicals in cigarettes and my driver smoked, the residue of which I reacted to strongly over the 45 minute ride home, but faced with the prospect of being stuck in the open overnight... This expense alone establishes material injury beyond the unjustified inconveniences based on racism permitted by political narrative (the entire BLM and leftist mantra of a white male being somehow 'elite' and privileged etc., when I did absolutely nothing out of the ordinary or impolite until a black person expressed their racist opinion and that they had the power and would exercise it to counteract my perceived ""entitlement.""). Throughout I remained firm and unyielding but civil and polite, and the videos will confirm that assertion. They were all filmed from a public access sidewalk, and not on any private conveyance or property (I never got even a step on any train by their forceful interference) therefore easements and public lack of privacy expectations apply (the black employees and an offended passenger who added her own snide remarks were ignorant of these facts) because the offenders of course at some point made it clear they did not wish their misconduct recorded.

Following this, and getting home late that night, the weather and chemical exposures, no doubt in combination if not alone, I began experiencing extremely painful seizures that repeated intermittently for hours, further depriving me of sleep, which can be evasive at the best of times due to breathing problems, one of the multiple health matters for which I assert my lawful (under any scenario) disability and exemption from their b.s.. Which I've done for the past year, and have never had any problem except an occasional snide comment, usually from another passenger less informed. Today I'm still in a lot of pain and of course a sleepless night after nearly 24 hours of activity related to preparation and travel for a sorely needed side job (photography, self employed gig). The seizures have stopped early in the morning but this is not a laughing matter and even the first conductor's behavior, apart from anything else that followed that he also caused with deliberate intent and out of and beyond his normal duties actions, was found by station employees who overheard it, witnessed it and me throughout, or heard it relayed to them by other Amtrak employees, found it completely out of line and improper, even without hearing the implied racial comments, and who told me (multiple individuals) just let it go and take the next train, there should be no hassle with the next one. One such employee specifically said ""maybe it's time someone sued Amtrak over this nonsense.""

A call to Amtrak with a very extended wait while I was trying to find an alternate route home last night, determined that ALL Amtrak conductors did not know company policy and had incorrectly informed me of numerous facts and policies and procedures, but if those same policies and procedures were followed, they still violated Title II of the ADA and their own pulbished policies, and they did not provide me a route home that night, compounding the injury done.

The insanity in CA really gone too far, and various comments by Amtrak employees made it clear that it is an ""open secret"" that Amtrak is a leftist dependent and would no longer exist without handouts and subsidization and this in turn foments more divisive and inappropriate behavior and thoughts. This alone, with the fact that they'll ultimately pay legal fees for their violations of their own policies and federal law (discrimination, and failure to abide by ADA) I would hope would attract an attorney to make a point. I regret needing to rely on them for much of my local regional travel.

I have had countless similar encounters and threats of violence over the past year in CA. The leftist fear-mongering, terror tactics, and narrative in CA are beyond out of control. I could provide an ambitious attorney(s) with numerous actions against a few other very large corporations who violated ADA and equal protection laws and fell back on the political narrative to justify their outrageous and unlawful violations. But this one, with the night of agony that followed, definitely went too far. Getting several blacks violently riled up against me without cause was beyond unconscionable, not to mention deliberately trying to strand me, inconvenience me, and prevent my return home should not be allowed to be swept aside and forgotten.

****************************************************

I took ill for three days following sending this to my initial attorney for a local referral due to exposure and breathing related matters collateral from the unexpected exposure.

Note that all of this behavior violated ALL of Amtrak's own published policies and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. It also violated all published policies of Amtrak, or ANY related ""mandate"" or related issue, as ALL SUCH refer back to ""per CDC guidelines"" which I keep bookmarked on my phone for reference, and which explicitly say individuals such as myself, are, and always have been, exempt from any such mask or similar expectation or ""requirement.""

Note also that this exact verbiage above was attempted to be transmitted direct to Amtrak through their site, and an automated email issued in response claiming that ""hate speech"" was detected above and the request was not processed as a result. Multiple attempts to submit provided no differing result. Reference to unfulfilled Amtrak reservations: B0B66E & B067C7. Numerous prior reservations over the past year without any incident related to discrimination (I didn't even complain when I got stuck in Union station overnight due to an Amtrak employee error that stranded me at my expense) or similar violation of my ADA rights to transport unhindered."

912,complaintsboard.com,"Hello, 

I recently had to book a train for my in-laws to come visit us. After numerous times trying to use your website which does not work at all, and no one seems to be correcting the issue, I was told to call Customer Service to book my travel.

I spent about 1.15 hours on hold waiting to book my travel. The person who took my booking did not spell my email correctly, so I never received any confirmation of the dates/times.

I called today and spoke to a person named K. after being on hold for 1.5 hours. His aggressive and annoyed tone (like I was imposing on him) were not appropriate. He was going to email me my itinerary, and said he sent the email. I spelled my email address to him and he said everything is spelled correctly on his side, and to check my spam/trash/etc.

At this point I asked to be transferred to a manage, he response was dismissive, telling me he would transfer me once we were done.

He then asked for an alternative email address and I was was telling him this address he realized he had spelled my email incorrectly. Now I clearly spelled this out to him, but he did not listen, instead he proceed to tell me he had spelled it out to me and I had somehow told him [protected] is correct. In what world would I say my email was correct if indeed it was spelled incorrectly?

The truth is he sent the email to the same address the original person spelled incorrectly. He did not verify my email address (again, I would not say that the email was ok if he would have told me what he had on file).

Once I finally received the itinerary in email he hung up on my without transferring me to a manager.

A couple of things:
1. Please fix your website? If the website were working I would not have had to be exposed to your customer service which was very poor IMHO.
2. Hire more customer service employees! I should not have to wait for over an hour or hour and a half to speak to someone. You need help here

I just noticed the suggestions for complaint details on your website, it say to be polite. K. was anything but polite, his tone throughout my experience was that I was wasting his time, he had better things to do, and I'm stupid - that was the experience."

They said norfolk Southern isn't communicating. Then why did another amtrak train pass us?

918,complaintsboard.com,"I bought a ticket good for 10 one-way trips between San Luis Obispo and San Diego, California. Travel Is limited to an 8-week period between July 26 and September 23.

The tracks were closed between San Luis Obispo and Goleta, California, amounting to approximately 1/3 of the total route, for three weeks during August. I needed to drive rather than take the train during that period.

Since travel was unavailable for those three weeks, it is only fair that Amtrak. extend the period for three weeks. However, I am told by both the San Luis Obispo station and a train conductor that Amtrak does not accommodate that basic adjustment. This is blatantly unfair, and I therefore request that my ticket be extended by the three weeks to compensate for the track closure.

922,complaintsboard.com,"I was a passenger on train #65 @ 10:22 pm from Providence R. I. to Thurgood Marshall BWI on August 7 2021. Resv. #123743

During that trip I was disrespected by the conductor. I feel I was blatantly discriminated against. I'm not sure if it was because I am a senior or because I am a lady of color. I was assigned a single seat so maybe he didn't feel I qualified to have a single seat. I still don't understand why I was treated that way, I really feel it was because of my color.
let me give some background:

From the moment I sat down the conductor came to me and said, ""I don't think you belong in that seat"". I showed him my ticket, he said, ""you can't sit here because I'm showing you as a no show"", my reply how can I be a no-show when I'm sitting here, he then said he show me as a no show going to Rhode Island, (surely I didn't walk from Maryland to Rhode Island). he insisted that I move that he could find me a seat in Coach. I said I paid for business and wasn't going to coach. He continued to come back and harass me, finally I agreed to move to a seat further up because by that time I was getting nervous and stressed out. He took me to the front of the car and said he had reserved me a seat in 1d when we get to New York. That trip to N.Y. was the most miserable ride ever. I felt every bump and twist, consequently my sciatic nerve was bruised.
Then to add insult to injury when we got to N.Y. I was seated right across the isle from my original seat and no one sat there from N.Y. to BWI, also before N.Y. I went to the restroom at some point and the seat was empty. I think he felt I did not deserve to be in business class and certainly not in a single seat.

That conductor needs people skill especially when dealing with Brown skin people. He need to know color discrimination is illegal and will not be tolerated. I'm sure your records will identify him.

I had already booked a trip for October 13 and 19, reservation # 56B004, I hope the employees are not as arrogant.

We were told if you had to do #2 to go to the bathrooms down below, because in our room bathroom had no exhaust ventilation. Really? Third world accommodations. At night the noise of banging, rocking & the springs bottom out to hit solid metal was not comfortable to get any sleep. Don't count on sleepy joe biden to help you with much needed repair on your tracks, he's only a puppet. This was bad enough, but to have one delay after another was over the top. Way too many trains & not enough tracks. Mechanical troubles & then crew ran out of time. Eight hrs late to Emeryville & missed our flights out of San Franciso to Fort Myers, FL. I would like a response, but that is unlikely.
When I hear people thinking about taking Amtrak, I will tell them about our experiences & suggest they fly or take Greyhound for better service.

931,complaintsboard.com,"As new equipment is ordered, here are suggestion to improve the quality. Emulate the airline by offering pillows and blankets, so that is one less carry-on passengers have to work about. Ad better quality seats and foot rests. current equipment is hard to operate and not very comfortable. Try adding seat-back tv-games. Follow your competition, the airlines. The window sill is slopped and would be better if level where you could rest your arm. Mid seat arm rests would be nice and too much space from edge of head-rest to the window, not conducive to resting against the window. Since most seats are on the second level, how about a door at that level to avoid the climb which is hard for older folks with baggage.

I understand that the dining car and lounge will be open to coach travelers; that would be very nice. Coach passengers are treat as second class riders when we pay a lot for a seat and car transport.

Now when it comes to trackage rights, Amtrak needs to lease a second track right of way so that we can not be held up by freight traffic. Build bypasses around yards to avoid slow orders."

937,complaintsboard.com,"I was on the #27 train, the Empire Builder and stepped off to stretch my legs and take a smoke break at the Spokane, WA train station at 2:20am this morning, June 27th. I asked the one train attendant outside on the platform when the train was going to depart, how much time I had, and he said ""A full hour"". He said I had an hour from that moment I asked him how much time we had, not ten minutes or five minutes left of that ""full hour"". I decided to then take a quick stroll downtown to sight see, being I seemingly had a full hour left. I did so keeping an eye on the clock and returned at 2:50am, a half hour later, under the full hour. When I got back, the train had left. I met up with a security guard named Tommy who brought me down to the Amtrak office to speak with Wyatt and Matthew, who took down the details of my carry on belongings and checked baggage. They radioed ahead to the next train stop following Spokane to gather my carrycots and have them return here at the Spokane WA train station the same time the next morning when the train's on its way back to Spokane and that my checked baggage goes to Portland Oregon, my final destination where they're held on to for me. I was then given a ticket to leave on the next train this morning headed to PDX around the same time 24 hours later on a day it's supposed to have extreme heat, without my water bottle, my ID, or my wallet so I could get something to eat in this time frame.

I think it's completely unprofessional for the train attendant to say I had ""a full hour"" when I seemingly only had 10mins left of that hour stop, where they split up the train, half going to Seattle and the other half going to Portland. He withheld telling me the exact amount of time left before the train departed the station. This has effectively stolen my time from me while putting my carry-ons in the position of potentially being stolen or damaged. It has messed up a scheduled ride I had for me this morning at 10:10am when I was meant to arrive at the PDX station that I will not have tomorrow morning. This has caused me significant emotional distress on top of my PTSD because it's not only my personal belongings, my identification and wallet and money, it's also my art portfolio that been taken out of my care effectively putting my intellectual property in jeopardy. This is an abuse of power and someone should not be in that job position to give ambiguous times of departure to travelers withholding the exact time, misleading the traveler to believe they have more time than they do per stop. This is completely unprofessional and disingenuous. Someone should not hold that work position with Amtrak to do this to any travelers again, who have paid for tickets and made other ride arrangements that then become totally messed up while putting the traveler's property in threat of theft, loss and/or damage. This train attendant was on the Empire Builder #27 from Memphis to Chicago to Spokane and is a middle aged stocky African American man who wears a Bluetooth ear piece.

My name is Kevin Andrew Jones.

939,complaintsboard.com,"I booked a ticket for my brother (age: 86) New Rochelle, NY to Meriden, CT on #148 etd 7:26pm. We arrived an hour early and saw that the posted time was changed to 7:56pm. There were no station attendants available for any updated information or to provide alternative connections. We waited until eventually a new time of 8:26pm was posted. At no time was any relevant announcement made. We waited. Other Amtrak trains passed thru, with possible connections to Meriden, but we had no way of knowing for sure. I tried calling Amtrak and listened to an endless supply of recordings while on HOLD. No one ever answered. It started getting dark and cold with no bathroom facilities nearby. Eventually the time was changed on the board to 8:56pm. My brother, by now, was very agitated and extremely nervous, besides needing a bathroom. An Amtrak train pulled into the station at 8:53pm. There was no announcement, no train markings and no conductor visible. My brother boarded the train. I started to leave and heard someone say it was the train to Boston. I became frantic and began waving my arms and calling for help. A conductor appeared from the front of the train, approached me and helped locate my brother who then got off.
A possible tragic situation was avoided. The correct Amtrak train finally pulled in 15-20 minutes later. Fortunately, this time the conductor was easily spotted in the middle car and confirmed this was the correct train. This 1hr - 45 minute delay was very unfortunate. The absence of ANY meaningful communication was irresponsible, dangerous and unforgivable. It would have allowed us an opportunity to decide how to best handle the situation instead of remaining clueless the entire time while sitting, waiting and not knowing what to do. 
This is the 21st century and we are able to make pinpoint landings on the Moon and Mars. How is it possible that Amtrak's service can be so terribly deficient and lacking in the basics? Amtrak must take responsibility to ensure that its passengers are not risking their health or their lives just by taking a 1 hour and 51 minute ride.

Now all we want is our money back. All day no communication or word from Amtrak and no way to get them to answer to get reimbursement.

After a nightmare trip last year in June 2020 when our train broke down in the middle of the night, we sat still for over 16 hours with NO info at all! No one would tell us anything & we couldn't get off the train. Finally, after a lot of trying, we reached a cust. service line and we were offered a partial favor by offering us a credit to use within a year. Taking this offer, trying to give Amtrak a break, we tried to book this year and the prices keep changing. On one day the tickets show as one price ($368 @ 20%), 3 days later they are doubled ($687 @ 20%), and 2 days after that they have tripled ($867 @ 20%). And occupancy still says it is the same. Called Cust. Serv. to verify and we were told 'that is the price, you will have to deal with'. No other explanation. Unbelievable that this long time company is so rude and un-accommodating. And can get away with Stealing from their customers.

This is false advertisement. The meals were nothing more than TV dinners with fancy names. I paid for a trip round trip in a bedroom sleeper car which include all meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. On the day of departure however, the train was late and fortunately for us we ate breakfast before boarding. The food was so bad I skipped dinner and we canceled our return portion of the trip and were charged $130 plus dollars; making a very disappointing trip even more undelightful. The train was later on arrival, which turned out to be a good thing because we had breakfast before loading. So neither of us had breakfast, and I skipped dinner because I could not eat that type of food again. The main complaint is the bad food and false advertisement. I do not mind getting a refund that can be used at a later date when you put your Chef's and fine dining back on board.

As we left SEA the driver began sweating profusely, wiping his face and brow for about 15 minutes and loosening his collar. These seemed like potential cardiac symptoms. Next he turned on the air conditioning blower three times, saying it was heat and acting confused. He drove 47 in a 35 mile zone approaching the Edmonds terminal. At no point did he ever use a signal when changing highway lanes. From Edmonds to Everett a continuous loud annoying alarm beeped. In Everett the Amtrak conductors tried to investigate the cause. The driver said it was the heat alarm and could not turn it off so there was a probable safety component that should not have been ignored.

We thought it was an explosion as the it was loud and then the train felt like it was derailing. Once the train straightened out, the car started filling with smoke. At no time in the next 20 minutes, did any Amtrak attendant come to check this out. A chemistry teacher who was on the train put out the first electrical fire. Nobody was told anything for a long time and 2 more fires started with a tremendous amount of smoke. Finally, they moved us to the other cars where we stood like sardines. We were then told they would take us to Jefferson City and buses would be there to get us to our destination. Then they told us that we were being pushed back to Hermann where there would be buses. We finally were told they were taking us back to St. Louis where we originated from. I realize that this was an Act of God, however it was handled very poorly by ALL of the Amtrak employees involved. I feel that I deserve a few free vouchers as I still would like to use Amtrak for my travels. I called and talked to several call center people who didn't really care and just quoted procedures.

This was a special event as it was the first playoff game in Levis stadium plus my good friend is from Minnesota. Train was scheduled to depart Sacramento at 8:59 am and was scheduled to be in Santa Clara at 11:37 am, approximately two hours prior to the start of the game. The train was delayed and we did not end up leaving Sacramento until approx 10:40 but were assured that we would still be in Santa Clara before the game started. Following several long stops at stations along the way, we arrived at the Santa Clara station at approx 1:40 pm. Due to the prolonged delays, we missed the pre-game ceremonies, national anthem, and the first 5 mins of the game (which included the first Niner touchdown). Very disappointed.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing regarding my extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment with my travel experience on Amtrak's Coastal Starlight Train Numbers 11 and 14 last week.

My husband and I were booked and paid in advance for Monday December 23, 2019 trip on Coastal Starlight Train Number 11 from Eugene, Oregon to Redding, California. Several hours into our trip we noticed we were freezing cold and there was obviously no heat. We asked for blankets and were told we could purchase them on the train but the train did not provide blankets. An hour later we learned that the heat had not been turned on. After another hour we found out that the heater was not working and that it would be fixed shortly, it was not. We again requested blankets, thinking an exception would be made under the circumstances. Instead we were told there were no extra blankets available for train passengers. There was no apology, no offer of a hot beverage, nothing. We traveled at night for nine hours without heat. We spent the entire trip in our coats and gloves.

Our return trip on Coastal Starlight Train No. 14 from Redding, CA to Eugene, OR on December 27, 2019 was a living nightmare! I checked the train status before we left the house and learned the train was delayed by an hour and half and we adjusted accordingly. The Redding train depot offers no services. There is lobby, there are no bathrooms, there is no seating of any kind and no shelter from the elements. Our train was scheduled to depart at 3:06 a.m. We spent 2 hours in our relative's vehicle waiting on the train. During this time, we checked train status both online and by telephone. Each time I checked there was a different time. People were gathering at the depot and were freezing cold. Nobody left as they were afraid of missing the train.

The information that was provided was vague and gave the impression the train would be arriving within the next hour. Initially we were advised the train would catch up and could be arriving sooner the projected. Customer service recording was of no help. With some digging, we learned there had been an incident with a ""trespasser"" somewhere in Southern California causing the delay. After several hours, the train status showed the train as being in Chico, CA and was momentarily delayed due to a ""trespasser"" (again). Each time the estimated arrival time in Redding was posted as another hour. There was no time to leave and find the nearest bathroom. People were relieving themselves in the bushes. There was no time to go get a cup of coffee to warm up without fear of missing the train. Based on the information provided by Amtrak there were several times people (myself included) unloaded our baggage and moved to the platform expecting the train's arrival. This went on throughout the night. It was horrible. It was only because one of the passenger's daughters worked at a Chico TV station that we learned our train was delayed in Chico because it had struck and killed a man on the tracks.

Since Amtrak was well aware of the incident, they knew the train would not be leaving Chico within an hour after someone had been killed. Why couldn't have Amtrak been honest with us and sent us a text when the train would be actually arriving, allowing people to get warm and grab some breakfast? Both my husband and I are disabled and senior citizens. My husband has Stage 4 terminal cancer and has a nephrostomy tube which requires regular access to a restroom or risk sepsis. The discomfort, frustration, and anxiety forced upon us by the way this situation was handled was unbelievable. Shortly before our train was due to arrive the Union Pacific employee took pity upon us and opened a small portion of the train depot office up to the few passengers still waiting for the train. Our train arrived seven and half hours late!

When the train pulled into the Redding station we all walked down to the car that was opened up. After standing in line a few minutes we were told we needed to turn around and go in the opposite direction, several cars down to board. Being senior citizens, we were now the last in line to board. We realized the train was behind schedule but the way we were herded on the train was disgraceful. I had the door slammed shut on me and the train started up again as we tried to find room for our baggage. There was no room for our bags and no one to help us find room. Once seated, there was no explanation for the delay and no apology. I incorrectly assumed we would be offered breakfast or at least a cup of coffee. I was wrong.

We were unable to sleep because of the constant intercom announcements for lunch reservations, lunch seating, complaints about people showing up in the dining car too early, and on, and on. Rarely did we see anybody from the train staff in our car. Once again, there was no heat. Young children were running up down the isle of the car going from car to car unsupervised. A disoriented gentleman was looking for his luggage insisting it was stolen. He obviously needed assistance but he couldn't find any help. He started to panic and it was obvious he had mental health issues that were being triggered. We became very concerned for our safety. When we finally located a conductor he dismissed the incident as funny.

Prior to arriving at our destination in Eugene, Oregon, we explained our disability situation to the conductor and requested assistance with our baggage. We were assured there would be numerous train personnel to assist us when it came to disembark. There were none. It was difficult to get to our luggage because the passengers who were getting off for a smoke break had blocked the baggage area. A couple of them had been drinking (per their statements) and were not real cooperative about moving out of the way or letting us through. There were no train personnel anywhere to be found.

Because we were late arriving, I received a parking ticket because I never anticipated I would need to pay for time after I was scheduled to arrive. The train ride in itself was quite nice and we would like to do it again but under the conditions we experienced on both trains, it was obvious this was standard operating procedure for Amtrak.

I have enclosed copies of our train tickets and request full reimbursement. I believe for the nightmare we were subjected to, the rude employees, the unreasonable time delay, and the sheer lack of empathy and courtesy we are entitled to just compensation. I hope your company is embarrassed by the way it conducted itself and will take immediate action to improve their customer service and communication with their traveling clients.

I will be expecting your response with full reimbursement for our tickets within a week of receipt of this letter.

Sincerely, 

Linda Graham

970,complaintsboard.com,"Bought 2 tickets, at separate times, not the same reservation. One passenger was drunk and both got kicked off train. They were not even sitting together when incident happened. They kicked drunk passenger off, then came and got other passenger whom was sober and again not even involved and kicked him off as well. They gave him no explanation, and had no reason to kick off the sober passenger."

Message:

My train (number: 2155) was cancelled on november 01/2019 at 07:20am from Boston (Bac Bay) to New York (Penn). I had to go buy bus because I had flight schedule and I would lose my trip if I waited for another train (if Amtrak gave this option because in that moment any of Amtrak's employees knews what is going in on). I order to refund the value that I paid in my credit card.

973,complaintsboard.com,"This letter is being crafted to express the indignation and horrendous event that took place at the Santa Barbara Amtrak Station on 209 State St, Santa Barbara, CA 93101. My family and I were traveling back home to Riverside, CA on Sunday, November 10, 2019 when the incident happened. While waiting for my train to depart around 11:15 am a child around the age of 5 or 6 was with her mother and she needed to use the bathroom. The small child was sitting in the waiting area moving around on the bench because she needed to use the bathroom. The mother noticed that the bathroom required a code in order to access the restroom. The mother went to ask the front desk attendant for the code so her child could use the restroom. The lady came back to where her daughter was sitting and informed her daughter the lady would not give her the code because she was not able to present her Amtrak train ticket. The child was weeping and squirming on the train stations bench because she needed to use the bathroom urgently. I went to the front counter and asked the attendant (Rosa Noriega) for the bathroom code and presented my ticket. I received the bathroom code and opened the door for the child and her mother so the child could use the bathroom. 
The window attendant (Rosa Noriega) storms from behind the ticket counter and approaches me in an irate and infuriated manor, stating ""Do you think I'm stupid, do you think that I am [censored]ing stupid."" ""I saw what you just did."" ""It's not your job to open the door for passengers."" I told the lady ""the child needed to use the bathroom and I was not going to let her use the bathroom on herself because her mother was not able to present her ticket."" The women approached me and began yelling and screaming in my face and threatened to call the police on me and my family and to cancel our train tickets home. I told Rosa that she needed to back up and get out of my face and she would not disrespect me and talk to me in the manner that she was. Rosa continued to threaten me, putting her finger into my face and into my chest. I backed up from the women to avoid physical contact and she began to move closer connecting her chest with mine. I told the attendant to call the police because she had become uncontrollable and unruly. During this time, the other passengers that were in the lobby had become fearful because of the altercation had gotten out of hand and unpredictable. The small child and her mother hid behind the door bathroom because they did not know if the woman was going to attack them for going into the bathroom. 
As stated in the first paragraph I was traveling with my family which included my sister who is 18 and my daughter who is four years old. My daughter and my sister were in fear because of the verbal altercation and the physical contact the Rosa made with me. I began calling the police and Rosa walked away back to her ticket window. After the lady walked away, I spoke with the Amtrak Police officer who was on duty at the sight and expressed to him what happen inside the station. He made it clear to me that this is an ongoing issue with this specific employee and her supervisor. He expressed that passengers complain daily in regard to the lack of customer service and degrading interactions that are experienced at this station by this particular person and her supervisor never addressing the problems. I filed a report with the Amtrak Police officer and with the local police department. Santa Barbara City Police were called out to the scene because I was verbally and physically assaulted by this Amtrak employee. In addition, everyone in the lobby waiting for there train were in fear and my four-year-old daughter and sister who were traveling with me at the time. I am exercising my right to file charges on this employee, and I will be contacting Amtrak headquarters and I am considering filing a lawsuit against Amtrak after being attacked by one of their employees in front of my child. I will be contacting all Santa Barbara's local officials, so they are aware for the poor experiences their tourist are experiencing. No passenger, customer or citizen anywhere should ever have to endure the verbal and physical abuse I have witnessed in Santa Barbara at the Amtrak station while traveling with my family. While at this station I witnessed nothing but degrading, demeaning, and humiliating interactions amongst the customers by Amtrak employees. From the window attendants to the supervisors who are in charge. No one is present to help or resolve any questions or concerns that take place while visiting this station. 
I am highly disappointed in the overall environment and customer service that is demonstrated at the station. I should not have to travel with my family and be attacked for allowing a child to use the bathroom. I should also not have to travel with my child and have her in fear because a woman attacked her mother at the train station. I will continue to escalate this matter until this issue is resolved and it never happens to another passenger, not just at the Santa Barbara location but any Amtrak location. This company should be ashamed to call themselves America's Railroad if their passengers and families are being disrespected and verbally abused while traveling. To hire people of an angry and aggressive nature says a lot about your company's morals and how they value the people who use this service.

974,complaintsboard.com,"The 16.19 train was delayed considerably. No prior notice was given by either text or email, so my wife & I duly arrived at the station not long after midday & checked our luggage. I subsequently learned a goods train was earlier derailed between Albuquerque & Flagstaff during the early morning of that day & we would be bussed to Flagstaff.
We waited in the station, as no estimate of the departure time of the bus was given.
It was 19.00 hours before we boarded the bus, & gone 01.00 hours before arriving at Flagstaff, where my wife was given a sandwich (wrap), but was unable to acquire any food for me as I was checking the bags were being loaded and your employee said he could only hand out sustenance for me in person! Consequently I had nothing to eat at all.
It was after 13.30 hours before we got to bed (we are both 71 years of age).
Needless to say we arrived in L.A. extremely late, which upset our plans.
I await your proposals in respect of compensation for this considerably upsetting episode.

975,complaintsboard.com,"Reporting Negative Experience and Incident That Took Place At The Naperville IL Amtrak Station With The Amtrak Employee and Manager Name Rebecca On October 21, 2019 around 12pm. I was informed by Rebecca that she is the Manager there.

This is my first time here at the Naperville IL and needed help with direction about which side of the train track do I needed to go to take the Amtrak train that I was waiting on.

3 employees were working there. And I was greeted with anger, frown and evil eyes by the employee there. Who didn't want to help with question about where do I take Amtrak Train which area of the station. But very nice to others and helpful who were her own race there at the station. I was discriminated against hurtfully by the employee. I had to ask for help with questions from other train passengers instead. At the station, they also service Metra Train and Metra bus there as well. So I was a bit confused about where, I was to take the Amtrak Train for my travel destination."

On 9/23/19, my girlfriend Carmen Nelson and I took the SW Chief from Los Angeles to Chicago and then the Wolverine from Chicago to Pontiac arriving on around 1 AM on 9/25/19.

Our experience on the Chief was a bit out of the ordinary and left us with quite a bad feeling about traveling by Amtrak again. First of all, there were 2 young children who were sitting across from us who demanded our attention so much that after the first night we had to request to move. The parents were in the seats in front of us and all they did was give those kids cookies which sugared them out and made them even more hyper and needy for our attention all night long. Cute kids, but they never let up needing and wanting our attention more than they wanted the attention of their parents. The conductor put us on the lower level in a much more peaceful area which made us happy.

Our second day was better downstairs and we slept better.

But in the morning on the third day after having breakfast in the dining car, when we returned to our new seats, the 2 ladies across from us reported that our seats had an electrical burst of flame (fast fireball) and sparks coming from right about where my girlfriends head would have been if we had not been at breakfast! No joke, this was ""shocking"" to say the least and the conductor told us to move to another seat. The ladies said that a train employee had been fiddling with a breaker during the time of this incident. The rest of our ride to Chicago was fear filled and apprehensive. And we feel we need some explanation as to what happened in our seating area.

The ride from Chicago to Pontiac was normal and we detrained and went on about our vacation which included my 50 high school reunion.

I feel you need to know about this and what happened to us and possibly let us in on what really happed to our seating area.

Going to San Diego, the trip was delayed 45 minutes, while returning we were delayed and hour and half with other depot issues. The train was 2 minutes outside the Grover Beach Depot, and became delayed a 1/2 hour. Minimal information was provided to passengers who were already late to their final destination by an hour.

979,complaintsboard.com,"I travel daily between Exeter NH and Boston North Station. Increasingly the train is late on arrival in Exeter and hence Boston. My understanding is this late arrival is due to ""switching problems"" at more northern points along the route.

My simple request is that these switching be corrected. Like my fellow passengers, I rely upon timely arrival at my intended destination. While I understand an occasional late train, the frequency in the past few weeks is becoming the norm. Eventually I shall seek other modes of transportation, likely along with other passengers, because I cannot endure waiting upwards of 30+ minutes outside during the winter months where the temperature often is sub freezing. This situation is becoming untenable."
980,complaintsboard.com,I am on northbound train 2168 and it is delayed. An all too frequent experience. We pay higher rates for the fastest service and can usually take a regional for the same time in the end. The excuse today is that bad weather impacted switches. I heard this before and not likely that this is the issue but I have let 10 delays go without saying anything this time I am very impacted.

I am writing this email / letter in an effort to strongly express my dis-satisfaction with the service and customer support my wife and I experienced on our recent journey from West Coast to East Coast and back again on Amtrak trains.

We left Portland, Oregon in early July this year (2019) heading to Boston to see our son. It was, my realized after our travels were completed, the best of the journeys we encountered.

The ""porter"" David was attentive and pleasant and always made us feel ""at home."" However, when we dis-embarked in Albany (because the tracks were ""under repair"" and the train could not take us to our final Boston destination) the reps were anything but. AMTRAK, in its wisdom, informed us the last ""leg"" of our journey from Albany to Boston would be by bus but failed to email us ""confirmation"" of same the people in charge in Albany refused to let us on the bus. After 15 minutes of numerous phone calls, the man in charge simply said, ""get on…I don't care anymore"" and off we went on a 5-hour ride. This was, we were assured to be a deluxe bus…but it was anything but. Cramped seats, a small packet of nuts, a small paper container of water and no toilet for a 5-hour ride? Then with each stop, the driver announced that we were not allowed to get off the bus, that it was a brief stop *(only to witness it as a smoke break for the driver and helper) then back on the bus until we arrived at Boston south station around 8PM.

I will ignore the delays on the 2nd round of travel from Boston to Chicago…I understand, they do occur.

BUT…on the Zephyr from Omaha to Sacramento! A 2-hour delay (leaving at 11PM - didn't until 1:00AM). The porter (Curtis) greeted us at the door, put our bags on to the train then pointed the way to way we could store them…
- He made up the beds, tore them down…and we never saw 
saw him again.
- Car 0531, room 15…a family bedroom…paid for a private
toilet. Didn't get it. 
- FREEZING! To which Curtis responded, ""Hmm…well I
couldn't get it cool yesterday."" And the following day, we
were told ""Well, you're in the biggest room, move about."" 
- 1 electrical plug in this age of electronics? Really? 
- And no WIFI? 
The room was dirty…
trash in the bin and receptacles next to the beds were not removed;
footprints on the walls as though we were in a hotel were the [censored]s brought their ""johns""; 
duct tape used to repair the upper berth ""floor"" and keep it attached; 
air conditioning vents that had not been cleaned since Coolidge was President; 
a drill bit found on the floor because we stepped on it
the toilets were filthy, soap dispensers leaking; [censored] caked on the sides of the bowl, water on the floor
And we're paying $2000 for this journey to Sacramento?

On the Coast Starlight to Portland;
- boarded at midnight & our porter Dan greeted us, put our 
bags on to the train and pointed to a spot where we had to
store them.
- Our roomette was satisfactory but again, the air 
conditioning kept the room at an uncomfortable 
temperature (too cold!) with no way to modify it
- $23.00 for a steak dinner? $39.00 for steak & lobster?
AMTRAK is government subsidized - these kinds of prices
are outrageous! It matters not that as ""sleeper car"" patrons 
we were not charged but then to be expected to tip these 
employees who did nothing but their job? The only one 
who smiled and paid attention to us was Javon ( a waiter )
and therefore the only one who deserved a tip (and he got 
one!)

So, $3500 (approx) from Boston to Portland and this is the kind of service we were provided.

To say I am dis-satisfied is an understatment.

Do not say you're sorry because you're not. You're AMTRAK and You don't care.

The very least you can do is offer me a 1-way (NOT round trip!) anywhere in the US, open-ended ticket for 2 people in a 1-bedroom to make up for your terrible service…but you won't do that, will you? No. Because you will determine that I am a kook, a dis-agreeable customer who will never be content, one of thousands who travel on AMTRAK and ""love"" it.

Well, this is the 2nd time I've taken the train cross country AND back again and I can tell you, it will be the last!

No, you will remain in business…bilking the poor sons-of-[censored]es out of their hard-earned dough for many years to come and not giving one good god-damned for their comfort to making a pleasant trip.

Just know I am no longer a fan….and, here's the most important point: I will let everyone I know what I think about your trains, your people, your service, you attitude…and there isn't a damned thing you can do about that.

Thanks for a ""grand"" time."

994,complaintsboard.com,"On August 16, 2019, I purchased a round trip ticket $11 for Coaster from Poinsettia to Santa Fe at 723am. The Coaster was scheduled to depart San Diego to Poinsettia station where I had parked my vehicle at 1249pm. The guy standing at the ticket vending machine stated that Amtrack from San Diego will depart at 1115am and stop at Poinsettia station. He helped me to put in my $12 into the vending machine to purchase a ticket and said to ask the ticket inspector on Amtrack train where is the Coaster station in Poinsettia so I could get a refund for part of the round trip ticket I did not use for the Coaster. I asked the lady at the gate checking tickets if the train does stop at Poinsettia in Carlsbad and she stated it does. In the Amtrack train, I asked the inspector to point out where the Coaster office will be so I could ask for part of the Coaster refund since I only used one way, not two ways. He said the Amtrack will stop at Oceanside not Poinsettia. I informed the ticket inspector I was told by the guy at the ticket vending machine and the female inspecting tickets at the gate that the Amtrack will stop at Poinsettia. When I reached Oceanside, I spoke to the female at the Amtrack
office and was told that they cannot give me a refund. I had to get on the 101 Breeze and informed the bus driver to drop me off near Poinsettia where my vehicle was parked.

Bottom line, I am requesting a refund for incorrect information given by the guy at the ticket vending machine and the female inspecting ticket at the gate of the San Diego Coaster/Amtrack station.

I have the Coaster and Amtrack tickets if you need verification."

996,complaintsboard.com,"As a senior I have difficulty getting around. 
I traveled from Chicago station to Princeton, Illinois along with my two young granddaughters. The Redcap that took us and our 2 bags out to the train made sure we got on the train okay. He said as soon as he got us on he would put our luggage on the train also. As soon as I got my two granddaughters settled I went to make sure our luggage was where he said it would be. Unfortunately only one bag was found and I immediately reported this to the conductor/steward. He said he would check the next car and not to worry. 
Long story short, my other suitcase was found 3 days later in Emeryville, California. Luckily I had a name tag on the bag. At that point I thought ""great, we'll have it back in a couple of days. That is not the case! The person in lost and found told me I had to re-file a lost bag claim stating the last place I saw the bag was Emeryville station then they could take information from me for me to pay to have it sent back to Illinois. 
Well, it is 10 days later and I am still trying to get ahold of Customer Relations to dispute the fact that 1. I have never been in Emeryville and 2. Why do I have to pay to get a personal item back?
I did not complain when my first train the day prior was 2 hours late for boarding and I almost missed a connecting flight out of Midway airport. Now they are telling me I have to pay for my own bag to be shipped. 
I am so frustrated that I feel like letting my attorney handle all of this!

999,complaintsboard.com,"I've got tickets from Little Rock to Dallas, departure on the 31 of July and returning on the 7 of August 2019. First the ticket was for 30 of July but the Amtrak train was so late (5 hours) that I had to change the day to the 31st. No one could explain why the delay. On the return home was a nightmare, because the train attendant ( the one outside getting the tickets) was very rude and impolite, send me to the wrong car, and when I've Questioned her about the situation she said "" can you not read?"". I knew that I was going to a sleeper car with my 3 years old child and I have disability (but I can read and speak 4 languages) but did not know which car to go. I wish I had her name to tell you but I was so perplexed about her comment that I forgot to read her name tag. The train was so hot and the air conditioner was not working in my room, Jason said he was going to take care but did not. Jason was polite and helpful with my luggage and I tipped him well. I always take the train to Dallas and it is pleasant most of the time to travel by train, my whole family loves it, and the kids adore the trip. We are planning a long trip to North West with my family but I am concerned about it. I think when you pay for the service you should get it, and if you work with costumers you need to at least have a good attitude and politeness if not a smile. Ive lost a day of my my vacation, and had my feelings hurt and a massive back and head pain, ( the car that caries people to the train was full so I had to walk with my grandson in a 100 degrees Dallas heat). I know that people are not perfect but I do not like disrespect. The food was not edible on the return trip, but delicious on the departure.

We were on the second seating for dinner which was after 9pm the server said they were out of food he only had chicken sandwiches which irritated my husband which he asked for bread rolls and he told us that's on the sandwiches and no more salad then came back later to say no more chicken sandwiches so my husband left the table with no food the server said he had one dish he said was really good but it was not if you had seen it you would not had eaten I took a picture of it. and the room the room was not clean there was dirt under the bed and my husband got other customer hair and filth on his sox. so the morning for breakfast i received molded fruit and I showed it to the server and he offered me nothing else . my husband did not come for breakfast. we were aware of the bus picking us up from Jackson miss and ask will we receive lunch and they said no lunch but we did get boxed lunches before taking us to new Orleans and we arrived very late I feel the refund was not enough with all that we went through . it not right to have one server and one sleeper attendant . we got very poor service.

I complained many times about my return date. I was told not to worry. It seems that is all I hear from them. First they change my hotel without contacting me (they booked the wrong date of my arrival). When I called to get it changed back to the original hotel. Now I have received the travel documents, things are still incorrect. 
1. They didn't schedule my boat ride.
2. They have the wrong date for me returning home. Which means lodging stay is incorrect.

On top of this, I am being told that to correct this, I will need an additional $1, 000.00 on top of what I already paid."

1017,complaintsboard.com,"I recently took a field trip with my daughter first grade class. We rode amtrack from Corcoran ca - Sacramento ca. The train ride home was a complete frustration & disaster. There were 4 1st grade classes participating for this trip. 200 seats were purchased for the children & their parents. Our group was shortened 40 seats on the way home. I do not understand how this can happen. If 200 seats were purchased, how are 40 missed/looked over or forgotten? The seats assigned to our group were not organized together. I saw parents have to sit separate from their child the entire ride home. Some people had to even sit in the dinning car...As a mother that is not something I am okay with. It's a long ride, and the children need to be with their chaperone the entire time. There were also issues with the bathroom. For a good while only one restroom on the entire train worked. The others did not have running water or a toilet that flushed. Upon take off there was a horrible heavy smell that filled our car. It was similar to an electrical fire or burning oil. Our entire car had to cover our noses with shirts or sweaters for a while because the smell was so intense. Several of us were concerned there may be an actual fire. Half way through the ride home, the dinning car ran out of all their food. I would have thought with anticipation of having an additional 200 guests that day, they would have been better prepared for all the customers that would be utilizing the service of purchasing food on the train. Towards the end of our trip home, another smell started to linger in our car, this time it was that of a sewer or faulty bathroom. We felt as though we were sitting in a port-a-potty. I know a majority of us were left feeling very disappointed for our children. This should have been a positive enjoyable experience for many that have not utilized the public transportation of amtrack before. Over all, it left many of us feeling taken advantage of and not like we received the service our money went towards.

Going to Sacramento from corcoran was fine but coming back was horrible. Safety for the kids were questioned. The safety of our kids are priority of our teacher and parents. When we booked our fieldtrip last September, we reserved 200 seat, and we expected 200 seats and to be close together. We were given limited seats! For 200 hundred passengers! At least 50-60 parents with kids that doesn't have seat that they paid for in advance.. standing on the aisle! Conductor was called several times but choose to ignore us until last minute. The trip back was so horrible i will never use Amtrak again! And will tell everyone i know.. also bathroom didn't want to flush! Conductor was also notified! Still didn't get fixed. if your reading this and planning for a school field trip its better to use a bus than Amtrak it is safer in ways u cant imagine."
1020,complaintsboard.com,Our school reserved 200 seats as a group for a field trip with 1 st grade children. Seats were reserved and paid for in September. Amtrak failed to reserve enough seats for us both ways. Part of our group had to sit in cafe cart with general public when our children are supposed to be seated together for their safety. The train was moving and we still had parents and children going up and down the itrain looking for seats. This is ridiculous. Very disappointed in the lack of service.
1021,complaintsboard.com,We took our 100 1st graders o a trip to Sacramento on Amtrak today. The ride there was ok. But the ride home was absolutely unacceptable.

1022,complaintsboard.com,"On Sat 27th April at 12.25AM, My husband (73yrs.) and I (64yrs.) took your bus from San luis Obispo to San Jose CA. I would like to register a complaint about this journey.
After struggling to find two seats together, we crammed into our seats. After 10 minutes, we began feeling hot & uncomfortable and soon discovered why. The overhead lights in the entire bus went on and could not be turned off. The heat coming from the lights was unbearable. Upon trying to turn on the fans, overhead which were next to the lights, we found they didn't work either. There was an announcement from the driver that the lights would have to! remain on or we would have a delay in the schedule. The en. tire trip was like sitting in a sauna! Between the heat and the cramped space, I started feeling claustrophobic and so di zzy, I nearly fainted. There was no water, and nowhere to buy any because of the time (after 1AM). My husband and I tried to take our minds off our discomfort by going online. However, the WIFI did not work nor did the outlets when we tried to plug our ipads in!
Ijust wanted to tell whomever is in charge, that this was the worst, most uncomfortable bus trip we we have ever taken.
I hope something can be done about this asap.

1023,complaintsboard.com,"I have been a member of Amtrak Guest Rewards for a number of years. My wife and I recently took the Lakeshore Limited and City of New Orleans from Syracuse, NY to Chicago, IL to New Orleans.

The first leg of our trip was uneventful. 4/13/2019 on Train 49. I woke early enough to stretch my legs in Toledo. The temperature was 38 F and there was blowing sleet in a strong wind. I was in the dining car and mentioned to the attendant, Mike, that I would like to step out. He kindly opened the door and allowed me out on the platform. I walked for a few minutes, and it felt great. Mike remained on the platform monitoring me the entire time. He must have gotten uncomfortable, but was unfailingly pleasant. He treated me as I expect to be treated, as a valued customer.

The second leg of the trip was to NOLA. 4/14/2019 on Train 59. Brian was our car attendant and was very attentive and pleasant. We spoke for a while about the 8 hour delay into Union Station for train 58. Brian stated that he was on that train, and had not slept in about 30 hours. I couldn't tell, because he was very efficient in his duties. Except for helping me with my bags. I am 68 years old and don't mind assistance. I welcome it.

There was a supper served at 9 PM in the Dining Car. There were two tables fully occupied, a table with one couple and 7 tables vacant. My wife and I sat at a vacant table and were promptly asked by the attendant to move to the table with one other couple, which we did. That left seven tables vacant.

We ate a VERY disappointing Muffaletta. Almost tasteless. And it proved to reside with me for a couple of days. The server was surly. We finished our meal. There were still seven empty tables.

Breakfast was more of the same. One table fully occupied, one with one occupant, 8 empties. We were told to join the one occupant by a server who was, to understate the case, RUDE. We waited a very long time for the meal and ended up wishing it had not come. Some sort of egg/potato/sausage dish that was not completely heated (HOT AND COLD in One Dish) and was almost inedible. We finished our coffee and left. Still 8 unoccupied tables. The server was RUDER if possible.

I should mention that we had three carryons. I carried them up the stairs, and I carried them down the stairs. The attendant was nowhere to be found.

My wife and I had paid a first class rate and were treated as steerage. And fed accordingly.

We returned on 4/20/2019 Train 58. More of the same. Our attendant greeted us, and that was the last that we saw of him.

We were informed by someone that dinner would be served at 4 pm and 5 pm and would we like to make a reservation. We chose 5 pm. We learned later that there was serving at 6 and 7 also.

Same seating as before. Forced into an occupied table while many remained empty. A chinese noodle dish so bad that we left most of it behind. Poor service and long waits.

I wanted to retire at 9 PM so I used the button in our room to call Akeen at 8:30. The light on the call remained on for a full hour. No Akeen. I went looking for him. Couldn't find him. Asked a very rude attendant in the dining car how to find him. The gentleman was less than helpful.

I returned to my car and happened to run into someone who knew Akeen's location. I found him, He said that he never heard the buzzer/signal. FINALLY in bed at 1030. An hour and a half after my desired time. We asked for extra blankets since the car was very cold. Turned out that was a great idea.

I woke and went to the sightseer car. Very cold.

Went back to my room, very cold. Could see my breath! Had to don heavy clothes. And we were still cold.

Skipped breakfast. Had no desire for rude service and/or bad food.

Arrived in to Chicago. No help with bags.

A truly miserable trip on the fabled City of New Orleans!

Our last leg was on Train 4800 on 4/21/2019. Our attendant, Kevin, actually HELPED WITH MY BAGS! He also mentioned that there was a complementary drink waiting in the diner. We went and were served by the same affable attendant from our trip out, Mike. He was friendly, courteous and allowed us to sit by ourselves, even though two other tables had room for a couple. What a nice treat!

Our train was late getting into Syracuse, so we headed to the diner to be served by Mike. Again, tables were occupied by fewer than four. Again, Mike allowed us to sit where we wished. And another surprise...the lunch was not only edible but actually tasty! I had the antipasto and my wife had chicken in sauce. Mine was delicious, hers was delicious and Mike was the perfect attendant.

The train arrived in Syracuse late. Kevin assisted me with my bags. A good trip.

I checked the dollar value of my trip. According to Amtrak's site, the round trip, from SYR to NOLA and return, with 4 bedrooms, costs over 3300.00.

I also checked airfares. A FIRST CLASS trip, on Delta, from SYR to NOLA for two costs 1500 dollars. It is shorter and according to friends who have taken the trip, much more pleasant.

A train trip is an adventure. I've never demanded that I be treated as a first class passenger, and I won't now. But I should always be treated as a valued customer. And that was severely lacking on the City of New Orleans.

Strongly suggest that you get people from the Lakeshore Limited to train people on the City of New Orleans in HOW TO TREAT PASSENGERS.

I will be very surprised if I travel Amtrak again."

1028,complaintsboard.com,"On December 31, 2018, my sister and I (we both are senior citizens) took the noon train from Las Vegas, NM to Albuquerque, NM.

We were treated rudely by a female employee. Unfortunately, I did not get her name. She was in charge of assigning seats and checking tickets.

As soon as we boarded the train, she stated that we had too many suitcases, and that each person was only allowed to travel with one suitcase and one carry-on. My sister and I had a total of four suitcases and one carryon, besides our purses.

She said that this time she was not going to charge us for the two extra suitcases we had. Her tone of voice and attitude were very unprofessional, and I feel she verbally abused us and used her uniform to intimate us.

This was our second experience taking Amtrak, and we were very disappointed and hurt of the treatment we received."

1031,complaintsboard.com,"On 11/30/2018 the Amtrak train 505 departed PDX at 6:05 pm as scheduled.
It proceeded to the only scheduled stop at Oregon City, where we encountered a broken down Amtrak 508 going the opposite direction.
We then spent the next 1.5 hours sitting and going nowhere. It took another 2 hours for Amtrak to make a decision to tow the 508 back to PDX with our train 500, 20 miles away. It then took another hour to connect. It took another hour to get back to PDX. Train 500 then backed up and we sat another hour. 500 switched tracks and finally headed towards our original destination, 6 hours after the scheduled departure.

Not once during the entire delay did Amtrak offer passengers to get off of the train. Why wasn't there a bus alternative offered? We could have found our own ride to our destination! Salem is only 45 miles from Portland.
Ultimately, Amtrak kept all 93 passengers on 500 and ? on 508 hostage, unnecessarily! There should have been another non-passenger engine tow the broken 508 back to PDX. 
I agree, we did eventually get to Salem, nearly 7 hours later. Unacceptable! 
You have one job to do, transport paying passengers, and you don't do that very well at times. 
There were several poor decisions during this adventure.

At the very least, a complimentary travel voucher should be offered to every guest.

1032,complaintsboard.com,Train 58 in Memphis Central Station to Chicago. This station is under construction and was very confusing on where to get on at or check in at. The attendant standing out was not people friendly at all. We were with a group and came at different times one attendant enen though the we were to load was close he said we must go to the front for ticket scans.

Your conductor Fabian Perch was extremely unprofessional and rude to me. I bought a monthly Marc ticket and have been taking the Amtrak 85 train from Aberdeen to New Carrollton without a problem. Apparently the rules changed and the Marc monthly was no longer valid for the Amtrak train. When Fabian approached me I showed him my ticket and he..."

Train number 49 & 3 : train from New York to Chicago to Flagstaff
Our cabin number 4911 A . A sleeper cabin has a couple of issues that could not be rectified and for us unacceptable. ( Yes we are accepting of the situation as we don't wish to make James' life he'll in continueing to complain when he can not improve the situation to our satisfaction.)
A). The bathroom - toilet would not flush. My husband did number two's and it would not flush, we added extra water from the shower hoping that would help, it did a bit but not really there was still stuff left that wouldn't go down. We spoke to our carriage butler James - who was absolutely terrific, he tried but he is not a plumber. We believe that there's a leak or displacement in the suction hose. We were asked if we wanted to change cabins to a smaller cabin, we chose not to as we felt it was way too small for us, plus the $ we paid. Later in the evening (after 11:00pm) there was a consistent buzz in the speaker/vent above the storage rack above the hand basin that could not be stopped. We packed a backpack and blanket however it only reduced it a little. 
This, and the food offered for dinner (nothing short of a disgrace) is way short of our expectations of Amtrak. We were told by Americans that the trip that we're booked on is magic and we'd love the service... not sure about that...yes this is our first leg of three - New York to Chicago -res 839414, Chicago to Flagstaff res 839414, Flagstaff to Los Angeles - res 83947E. At this rate we can only complement our butler James - he's fantastic, a wonderful man with a sense of humour, very caring and loves his work.

Now the second leg of our journey is complete - Chicago to Flagstaff res 839414, toilet problems in our sleeper cabin again. This time the fresh water that rinses the bowl continually filled then overflowed. You had to flush the toilet every few minutes so that it wouldn't overflow. Paul, our new butler, did all that he could, but it took some 2 hours before he could turn off the cold water. This meant that the bowl could not be rinsed, you could not use the shower as no cold to temper the hot. The floor outside (carpet) ended up quite wet. The maintenance is ridiculous on these sleeper carriages, cost reduction is one thing but when it causes major discomfort to your clients it's another.

Our train was 4.5 hrs late into Chicago, which meant the sight seeing activities that we booked had to be thrown away as we had less than half an hour before our train Flagstaff was to leave. Staff were apologising as they had run out of food and could only offer tea and coffee, albeit with no milk/creamer as they'd run out of that. You guys have to get your act together.

The third leg was relatively uneventful, we just couldn't sleep very well due to the room dividing door rattling sooo much. We tried to stuff it, we succeeded a little but it was near impossible to sleep.

I know that we will never travel Amtrak again, let alone consider adding it to any of our plans. This experience (and it's cost) has made us realise that Amtrak are cost cutting far too far. You need to fix your trains to make the sleeper mode attractable. We also know that this email will be shoved aside and ignored, but you need to know the customer issues.

Kind regards. Jo'anne Reed"

1036,complaintsboard.com,"I was on train 29 from pittsburgh to chicago on car 2900 room 003 with arrival in chicago at 8:45 am. About a half-hour before detraining, I went to the lounge car and in about 15 minutes returned to find that my 20 dollar hat and a 20 dollar cigar were missing from the top of my carry on bag. I told the attendant about it but he was too busy to look for the items. I looked everywhere but could not find them. He told me he might have mistakenly put them in the trash. I told him why would he do that when they were on top of my bag between the handles. He just shrugged his shoulders and when I complained he told me nothing could be done. Then another person lost his wallet, but the attendant found it. Then the father of the person who lost his wallet stood with the attendant and said to me laughing, that he might give me back the hat but he would smoke the cigar. No one came to my defense. I complained that the items didn't just walk away. Again the attendant did nothing and said nothing. We detrained.
When I told the story to another attendant on the train to la, they told me that the attendant probably took my items. And told me to complain about the incident.
I'm a 77-year-old man, vietnam era veteran, with difficulty in walking, and yet no one could help me. How sick could that attendant be to steal from someone like me."

1042,complaintsboard.com,"My name is Juliette Lynn and the service on Amtrak Train number 97 heading down south was the worst experience a person can ask for.

Being a Disabled person ( Stroke Survivor) and a person with Bad knees, the bathroom is my number one concern! I specifically purchased Fabuloso and Clorox for The Bathrooms and they were were horrendous!

I pity how some of these people clean their house! Then the people using their cell phones after hours and after the conductor made reference to if they speak on their cells go to the bar car.

A baby crying for 24 hours was nerve racking..

Then the most startling experience was the very obnoxious and racist person that was screaming obnoxious statements ( to the conductors and his traveling partner was the worst thing one can witness, he was also very verbally abusive and the conductors did nothing to diffuse the situation. We All felt unsafe, in danger and I've been traveling Amtrak since 2013, traveling up north, but after that experience I am exploring traveling in the future another way, flying anything but that train.

* Back to the Disgusting bathrooms: Traveling on Amtrak one needs to feel safe, the female conductor with neck problems did her best, but after she would clean up, then people resorting to urinating on the floors, this was very unsanitary. Might I suggest a person needs to be assigned to that position mainly to clean the bathrooms especially on long train rides from West Palm Beach Florida to NY.

I am sure many will complain about this service and I feel as if a refund and or we should be compensated with a round trip ticket to make up for our terrible treatment..

I can be reached at [protected]@gmail.com and I would appreciate if someone can contact me immediately.

Not a happy camper

I'm upset because I was lied to by the agent who stated that there was no smoking on the platforms of the trains anymore. I knew she was lying because I take Amtrak often. so after complaining several times she then stated that she was told to say that by the conductor. I didn't know the conductor was allowed to make those types of on the spot rules. as the morning went on more passengers started to complain because they were not letting us off the trains to smoke. we didn't get to smoke until we arrived at Lake Charles. Second complaint was the delays. The train was 4hrs late which meant that I could not be picked up in time which also meant that I had to cancel my plans in Albuquerque and try to get a refund for reservations that was already paid for. I want to know how I am going to be compensated for the money I lost on my reservations and the time I wasted sitting on a train that wasn't allowing passengers to smoke"

1045,complaintsboard.com,"Today while riding Amtrak 80 20JUL 06:45AM-CHARLOTTE, NC, I requested a transfer ticket from the train to the bus. I was getting off in two stops, which was Salisbury, NC. Conductor Johnson did not have the transfer ticket. He passed me several times, and I continued to ask for the ticket. Since my stop would be coming up I needed the ticket. He never came back to give me the ticket. I had to walk down two carts to find him sitting down at a table. I asked him for the ticket again, and he said there weren't any. I explained to him that I have been riding the train all week, and I have been issued a transfer ticket to get on the bus. All the other conductors carried the tickets in their pockets. He said, he was alone. I told him this wasn't an excuse since he knew he had to provide this service to the customers riding the train. I told him the tickets should be a part of his uniform, and he said they weren't. When I got off the train, I still didn't have a ticket to transfer. I had to pay the bus fare that would have been free. The same conductor (Johnson) tried to ask the station personnel for a ticket. They do not carry the tickets, since this is a service received from the personnel on the trains. He was extremely rude, and told me I was having a bad day. I explained to him I wasn't having a bad day, I was asking for a ticket he should have provided. The ticket was included in the pricing of my ticket to work. I explained to him that if he had the tickets there wouldn't have been an issue. I would have received my ticket and been on my way. There should be some training given to this individual since he evidently has no idea about how to give good customer service. He even tried to say when I got off that he had given the tickets away. This could not have been the case when he admitted to not having any in the beginning of the ride. Charlotte was the first stop, and no one had left the train. I asked immediately upon entering the train. He never had the tickets with him. I shouldn't have had to pay for a free ride on the bus. Hopefully, he is disciplined for this since he is giving Amtrak a bad name."

Prior to this time I had traveled the Silver Star and the Silver Meteor several times.
I never in my life had such a rough, dangerous ride in my life. (I have a knee and hip replacement) and found it quite difficult to get around in my room.
At any rate during the night I was awaken every 10 minutes or so, my body being thrashed around in the bed. I was afraid I was going to be thrown out of the bed. This is absolutely no exaceration at all!
I cannot understand this, while aboard the Silver Star and/or Meteor I slept soundly with no disturbances at all.
To pay all that money and to be given such a horrible experience is awful. Not to mention the food was also horrible - this trip (including the food) leaves a lot to be desired. Not to mention the safety issues - they go without saying.
I am just hoping I can check into my hotel early so I can get some sleep so the day is not a complete washout. I am so grateful I decided to stay overnight in Lorton before making my long trip to Maine. That would only make things worse indeed."

Re: Complaint #4594974
Dear Sir:
On May the 30, (my mother in law) Grandmother, a senior and her 10 year old minor, grandson was on Amtrak Train #86 which departed from Washington, D.C. - Union Station to New York -Penn Station.
They found a seat together at a 4 seater (two pairs of seats looking at each..."
1049,complaintsboard.com,"I was on Amtrak train 507, 6:10 pm May 29, Seattle King St Station to Vancouver, WA (VAN), car 5, a new car, with tan/brown coloring (as opposed to the old blue color scheme). I have used Amtrak for years (first ride 40+ years ago).

The seats in this car were brutally uncomfortable - no padding, no way to adjust the position of the seat back (there was a level that looked like it would, but pressing on it did nothing, some mean trick). The seat was so high up my feet didn't touch the floor. I tried putting my travel bag under my feet, and my feet barely touched that, so it did not at all relieve the pressure on the backs of my thighs & knees. When I told the conductor the seat was uncomfortable, he said, he knew, and added that these seats are smaller. I said, ""I'm small and they weren't even comfortable for me."" (I am 5'2"" - not freakishly small, I should be able to touch the floor) He said, ""Well they have more leg room"" I said, ""I noticed when my feet didn't reach the floor."" He then said the car was a ""European design"". But I have ridden trains in Europe, long distance, subway and street cars, and never encountered such uncomfortable seats. He said that he wished the seats were the worse problem with these cars, but stopped himself and refused to elaborate - which makes me EXTREMELY concerned they may have safety issues.

When I went into the bathroom, I found that the grab bar was installed so low that it was across the toilet seat lid, so that lid could not be moved from an upright position, and could not be lowered before flushing the toilet (on a moving train - gross!)

At least 3 things need to be done: 1. The company(or companies) that designed and manufactured these cars must be held to account. The replacement of these seats must be at their expense. (In the meantime, the humane thing to do would be to put foot rests in these cars) 2. The grab bar/toilet seat lid situation must be addressed. 3. These cars should be investigated immediately for other more serious issues. Not that I think the seats aren't serious - it is unfair and unconscionable to cause paying customers PAIN - but I am deeply concerned after this discussion with the conductor yesterday about what other defects or dangers exist in these train cars."

At this point, I returned to my car and waited. I made a few calls to nearby friends who suggested I call police if I felt scared.
I made several trips from my car to the Fredericksburg train platform with my luggage in the RAIN. At this point, I was the only passenger boarding train # 0066.
The local bar had closed, leaving the area where I parked dark and desolate. As fear sat in, I called the non emergency city police dept.

Police arrived and requested I move my vehicle to a available parking area nearest the Amtrak platform. I moved my car where the office suggested. Upon my return from out of town, I was welcomed with a $25 parking ticket (parking in a permitted area without a permit!
Train 0066 arrived at 3:45am

My request is to be compensated for train delay and to request that Amtrak info customers a realistic time frame for delays and not string us along. I was going to DC and did not want to travel in the inclement weather, I understand that mother nature had a major part in the delay. Tell me that it will take over 5 hrs and I'd make other arrangements.
Amtrak left me confused, exhausted, weak and scared

Your assistance in this matter will be mostly appreciated.

1051,complaintsboard.com,"I have never traveled via train before.
My trip was from sacramento to north dakota. I booked the trip on short notice. I was in coach and lower level (for disable peoples, like myself) for most of trip but was in a roomette for part of the trip.
My time in roomette was fantastic. Gregory the attendant was very courteous, efficient. 
My time on coach was fair. My time in lower level was dreadful. The car was filth, black mold on the air vents. Difficult to get to food facility. After that time I understand how the lower class passengers of the titanic felt. I felt forgotten, in a unsafe position, disrespected and in general staff would prefer that I disappeared.
No food no drinking water. I was approached 3 time by pan handlers. I assume that many of my fellow traveler were homeless and were reaching out to any/everyone for help. One of my fellow passengers was caught smoking crake in the ""lower level"" bathrooms. She talked her way out of being kicked off train.
I am a 73 year old woman. I hope to never put myself in the position again. 
If I travel via train.. It will only be in a sleeper or roomette."

I told her I was going to DC. She said train 20 was on the other side again. I ride the train a lot to DC because my daughter and grandchildren live in Maryland. This has never happened before. I am disabled and have worked in Customer Service for 35 years. I would have asked to see the ticket. If I was white I bet she would have.

I normally ride the 3:44am train. If you look up my record you would see u ride the train a lot backwards and forwards to DC.

1055,complaintsboard.com,"I am Maryland resident and recently traveled to New York City on 3/19/2018 via Amtrak, and would be continued to Boston on 3/21/2018 for an interview on 3/22/2018 afternoon. I purchased airplane ticket flying back to DC after the interview on 3/22. Unfortunately, my 3/21 Amtrak train was canceled. I rescheduled the train to 3/22 morning. However, my 3/22 train was canceled again. Since I had no opportunity to catch up my interview on 3/22, there was no need for me to go to Boston, so I had to re-reschedule my trip back to Maryland on 3/22 late night.

What I complaining here is about an Amtrak agent I worked with on 3/22 in rescheduling my trip back to Maryland. The agent treated me very impatient and rudely: first she refused to reschedule my trip back to Maryland because I changed the destination. I explained to her that due to the Amtrack's back-to-back cancellation that 100% abolished my Boston trip, I don't need to go to Boston but go back to Maryland. Second, she insisted that I need to pay the charge for the difference (172 Amtrack award points). I asked if she could be so kind as to waiver the 172-point charge since this amtrak's back-to-back cancellation had made me pay one extra night hotel cost in NYC and my pre-purchased airplane ticket from Boston to Maryland which is non-refundable. The agent rudely denied my request saying that the cancellation was not Amtrak's fault. Come on, I had paid extra couple hundred dollars for the Boston trip due to the back-to-back cancellation, and 172 Amtrak Award points are less than $5 in value, why not Amtrak be responsible for this little cost for the cancellations, even after a customer requested for this? During the process, the agent put me in waiting for 5-6 times without an explanation! I purchased for Amtrak's services, but what I received was my trip was abolished, I had to pay extra money for nothing, and I was treated as problematic instead of a customer. I kept calm and asked the agent if I could talk to her supervisor, but she rejected my request again. The agent's rudeness, impatientness, unprofessionalism, and unethical behavior seriously hurt me as a loyal Amtrak customer.

I request a refund for my abolished Boston trip."

I checked in my RED suitcase at the DC station and to be pick up at my destination in Florida. Upon my arrival the suitcase was not there. I spoke with the employee, Orlando Sr, who had the luggage from the train. There was only one suitcase and it was BLACK. He stated that the Deerfield station does not check in luggage. I told him that I checked it in DC and was told it would be in Deerfield Beach. He politely told me he would check again but the train was already pulling out. I was told that if I had a tag/ID on the suitcase it would not have been lost. I explained to him that I did do this but he asked it I wanted to check the BLACK bag to see if it was mine? He ask to see my luggage receipt and I showed him, then he would not give the receipt back to me. He kept asking me to open the BLACK suitcase to see if it was my items in this suitcase? No one at the station was claiming the BLACK bag. So he proceeded to open the suitcase and lo and behold, all my clothing and shoes were in the black suitcase. And then all of a sudden my hand written tag that I filled out in the beginning of the trip was in his hand and stating that this tag was on the suitcase. At first he said there was not a tag/ID on the suitcase. My RED suitcase was locked before the trip and maybe someone thought there valuables or wanted the RED suitcase, I don't know. 
I wish to be compensated for the thief of my luggage due to the fact that it is part of a match set. And the cost of dry cleaning all my clothes that were in the old dirty black bag.

1062,complaintsboard.com,"I traveled from Springfield, IL to Milwaukee, WI in June. There were a number of issues with the trip, but here's my main complaint:

During the train portion of our trip, I visited the dining car with two other friends. I bought yogurt and a muffin, paid with a debit card. I wasn't given a receipt, and didn't think to ask for one since I was TOLD the charge would be for around $6.50. I also purchased a water, separately, with cash.

When I reached my room that night, I checked my bank account to verify the amount I would have for shopping the next night. To my surprise I noticed a $65 transaction from the Amtrak Cafe! I was shocked. I had purchased my ticket more than a month ago, and hadn't charged anything else at/on Amtrak that day, so I knew the charge had to be for my muffin.

I called Amtrak the next day, and was transferred from one department to another. I finally got a person who could help, and was told some BS story about how they don't handle refunds there, but she would forward my complaint to their refund department, and see what they said. She called me back the next day and said that they were going to look into it, and that it could take up to 20 DAYS to get my refund. Note that this was a debit card transaction, so it was my cash that they had, not credit. I had put a specific amount of money into my account for this trip. Because of this $65 charge, I ended up overdrafting. I was charged almost $70 in overdraft fees.

I contacted my bank (Chase) and explained the situation. They were nice about it, and immediately refunded all the overdraft fees, and I deposited some of the cash I had on hand to bring my account back to a positive balance. This wiped out all but my emergency funds for my trip. I had my husband transfer money from another account so that I had enough money on hand to eat.

Two days after I returned to Springfield, I received a call at 8 AM informing me that Amtrak had no records of the transaction, and therefore couldn't refund any money. They recommended I report it as a fraudulent transaction to my bank. I thought this was ridiculous, but followed the CS rep's (the same one I had dealt with from the beginning) suggestion and reported the transaction through the Chase fraud department.

Today (July 31st), well over a month past when I reported this to Chase, and almost two months since the original issue, I was informed by Chase that Amtrak provided documentation proving that this was not a fraudulent charge. Apparently it's only fraud if you never had any contact what-so-ever with the merchant. This the the SAME paperwork that they 'couldn't find' that required me to report the claim as fraud in the first place!

I'm furious. How the HELL did I get charged $65 for a MUFFIN, and why can't I get a refund?!"

Message: On Aug 23rd I took a trip from Redmond OR to LA Ca. two days before my departure, reservation # 66B1B. a Debbie from Amtrak cs called to tell me my seating may have been booked wrong and I may or my service dog, may not have a seat reserved... (even though I booked and paid for this months ago and had received my tickets and called and double checked reservation...) She called back later to tell me every thing is ok.. and I would have no problems. why did she just not take care of this instead of worrying me and those who this affected? There were so many problems this trip, I will just list problems not in a story mode. So it won't read easy however there were so many problems that this will be easiest. I got to the train station in Chemult oregon ( you bussed me from Redmond to Chemult) and caught the train. Things went great, service was awesome, air condition broke, so we roasted...literally as there are no windows to open for fresh air even.. We were told sorry if we turn on your ac the upstairs gets too cold, if we turn it off, you roast, they let us roast. they did open the car door but bathrooms do not smell nice and the noise from slamming doors from passengers at all hours, No wifi like we were told. but conductor announced stops and when ok to get off and commentated on scenery. It was great. then in San Diego we hit a person on the tracks, that delayed us 3 hours. It was at this time we were told there were vips on the train and they may be coming around to see how service is ( which explained the great ride and service up to that point) unfortunately they got off the train and it was obvious... we were delayed another 1.5 hours making us over 5 hours late into la. ( I do not hold the suicide as amtraks fault but the additional 1.5 hours of delay definitely was ( twice we were stopped for another amtrak train announced, and once delayed for inspection.) I guess amtrak felt we were already so late what did it matter if we were later? Not happy!

Then I returned on Sept 3rd that trip was a nightmare! To start with they tried separating me from my service dog. Several employees were rude to me about my dog making comments to other passengers. I said NO! you are not separating us.. ( which is illegal amtrak ada would be very interested in this.) then they told all to take a seat. I did and took a seat that had plenty of floor space for my service dog, faced the direction train was moving so I would not get sick, the car attendant came up to me and rudely said, cover the seat with a blanket if your dog gets on it, I said she is trained to stay on the floor, close but out of the way.(I found out later why he said that) He left. the air conditioning did not work again. so they left the car door open and unfortunately the bathrooms were close. the chemicals from the toilets literally burned my eyes..I have a medical condition which causes severe chemical sensitivities, let alone the smoking in the bathroom made breathing difficult. the constant noise from the slamming of doors was ridiculous! Our attendants were not that observant, nor did they come down very often. the attendants and others used our cabin at stops to put extra luggage in so if we had an emergency the disabled cabin door would have been blocked by fallen luggage and we would have been trapped inside car. The conductor did not announce smoke stops ( I do not smoke however that is the only times I can take my service dog out to do her business)about 12:30am at Sacramento our cabin attendant came in and ordered me to move to seat 81 and 82 which was so small you could not stretch out your legs literally only knee room, and my service dog could not fit between seat and wall laying down let alone sitting up ( it was facing wall)so she had to sit on the seat which took up most of both seats ( as she is trained to lay down out of the way) so I had to literally put my legs on her and with ac out that made it hotter and very dangerous as I could not get out of my seat hardly, others had to help me out as I had to sit on my dog to get out. - it was like time out punishment in a corner. Those should NOT be seats! I asked why as there were 4 other people in the car that had two seats for one person and plenty of floor space.. He made me move anyway. he did offer to turn the seat around but there was lots of luggage in that space so I would have had to deal with that and still had no floor space, and ride backwards. the other people laid down on two seats and went to sleep, including the lady that he gave my seat to. After he left, I got up with help pulling me up on top of my dog and stood or sat on stairs to upstairs in the on off door space until 2:30 am when another woman attendant came down. I told her look where me and my dog were ""seated"" we can not fit. She went inside, shook her head and woke everyone up to move us around giving me a seat this time where I had to ride backwards ( my original seat I did not because I get severe motion sickness and backwards riding does not help at all.) He put a Kathy H. in this small seat, she too is filing a complaint. the woman who took my seat apologized I told her I did not want kicked out in the middle of the night as amtrak has done if a person complains too much. she said I should not have moved. this cabin door had still not been fixed so the smell of urine and feces was overwhelming at this point . and the door open constantly allowed the mothers with screaming kids to come downstairs and into our cabin and let the kids scream and any one who wanted downstairs for what ever reason to be in the disabled car, many other women were not happy about this esp when men who caused problems and said things came in. finally door fixed then broke again, others came in and once the attendant said a man who was not disabled, could not sit there he said one more stop two hours away so he let him stay, this guy got up and tugged on door one of the other women shouted at him to leave it alone.. where was the attendant? he really busted the door now again trying to get it to close. they finally got it to close but by then the smell was so bad it made no difference, feces and urine, horrid! I could not even order food. ( which when we ordered yesterday the attendant after telling us not to forget his $10 tip, informed us the menu prices were not correct, I said that was your tip sorry... when we were not charged the menu price. Also one of the other passengers who had a wheelchair, not only got front row room for his chair but got two front facing seats to sit in on the trip, he informed me he was going from Sacramento ca to Birmingham Alabama in a sleeper car for 3 nights for $361.00 I got told for one night from oregon to ca $601.00 he showed me his ticket so verified it. he also got an additional 15% discount off his disabled ticket for having a public disabled pass ( which I also have) but I was not given and additional discount. Why the huge difference? 601.00 is ridiculous for a roomette he got a handicap room... and all his meals included. Also amtrak is supposed to give me reward points for all my train trips I have NEVER got mine and emailed numerous times still nothing or no response.

Comp a ride from redmond oregon to la calif any time of my choosing in a handicap sleeper car... and give me the reward points I have earned.. what is sad I have many people who wanted to take a train ride cross country and were waiting for me to share my experience... you loose amtrak., 

I could not put this in a time frame (bullets) as it was whole trip!

1073,complaintsboard.com,"I travelled on train 94 from Newport News to Philadelphia on April 11, 2011and found the cafe car operator very rude and ill prepared. It's a seven hour trip so I was on long enough for breakfast and lunch. She had no toaster or it wasn't working to toast my bagel. She was unapologetic and her attitude sucked. She acted like she was annoyed with me for asking. When I went back later for lunch the item I asked for wasn't available and neither was about 75% of the menu. How could you possibly not have lunch menu items at lunch time? Since there were no sandwiches I thought I'd have a soda and chips to hold me over until I got home. I asked for a diet coke and she threw a diet pepsi on the counter. I told her I wanted a diet coke and she said, again with no apology. ""we don't sell coke products"". By this time I'm fed up with her and said well I don, t want that. Do you have water? I didn't notice a name tag but I'm sure I provided enough info for her to be identified. There are a lot of people out of work so I'm sure she can be replaced. Maybe she could find something NOT in the service industry."
1074,complaintsboard.com,"On March 3rd 12:56pm EST, I booked tickets online for a trip with Amtrak.
I realized I made an error in the dates and on March 3rd 2:39pm EST (1 hr and 43 minutes later), I called to have those dates changed.
New dates resulted in a new price (lower). I was told by the person on the phone that I would be charged the new amount and sent the correct tickets. I know this because I asked specifically.

On March 4, Fed Ex attempted to delivery my tickets. When I received the envelope (March 8), they were the wrong tickets and (after checking my bank account) I was charged the wrong amount.
I called Amtrak, spoke with 5 people, including Customer Relations.
They essentially said that the only way for me to get my money bank (difference between original booking and new booking) and get correct tickets is to:
1) go to the train station now or wait for my trip and hand in the old tickets and get the new and my money back
2) send the tickets I have back at my own expense

I told Amtrak this was unacceptable. I am not near the train station and would like my money back before my trip. I also felt that I should not have to send them back at a cost to me, as I was given (evidently) the wrong information by the person who changed my reservation.

I was told, in no uncertain terms, that Amtrak would not issue me a pre-paid envelope or provide me with a shipping account number. I was told I could mail them back with a stamp, but without delivery confirmation, there's no guarantee they'd receive them.

I suggested that Amtrak refund me the $15 charge for sending me the tickets. I thought this was a good compromise. I was then told they won't do that because, you know, they DID mail me the tickets (even though I did not think they would be mailing me the wrong ones).

Understanding this may have boiled down to a communication error on the part of the Amtrak employee who changed my reservation, I thought that the $15 fee refunded to me was a reasonable request and would allow me to then take that money and mail back the wrong tickets.

Alas, I have been told by everyone I've talked to that they won't do it, and that going to the train station (thereby leaving me out that extra money for a while) or mailing the tickets at my expense are my ONLY options.

I was told by Brandy in Customer Relations that I was free to call the corporate office if I so desired. Which I did. I left messages with Joseph Boardman (CEO/President) and Matthew Hardison (Chief, Sales Distribution and Customer Service). But I was also told by someone else in the corporate office (when I attempted to reach HR) that Amtrak was never going to part with their money.

Really? Such a small amount to make a customer happy?
And really now, this is sort of an issue about principle. Shame on you, Amtrak.

It's unbelievable to me. And me, a long time Amtrak customer. Maybe not for long?"
1075,complaintsboard.com,I strongly feel Amtrak should be DEFUNDED IMMEDIATLEY. There should be little loss. If there is true need for train service a private company will come along. I have used Amtrak with horrible experinces. Employees are down right mean and lazy. There is NO customer relations at all. They do not give a damn about customers since it is Governemnt run service.

1077,complaintsboard.com,"Amtrak locks wheelchair bound passenger in train
Follows dangerous security protocol

He was trapped on a darkened train all because the conductor was in a rush to get to a party.  the lights and the engine were shut off. Amtrak's rules are straight forward-if your are disabled you are the first to de-train and red caps assist you with your belongings.

You are not locked on the train with the lights turned off left to fend for your disabled self unable to get your wheelchair off.

He was trapped and held against his will. Period.

What if he had collapsed as has a seizure condition that leaves him highly susceptible to falling? Worse he had just suffered a series of seizures and his eyesight had left him.

And security? What if this were a passenger that was intent on doing harm — he could have easily pulled off a massive disaster due to amtrak's lackadaisical excuse for security. 

We as travelers are harassed to no end, strip searched, body scanned, x-rayed, all except when the conductor or pilot has another arbitrary concern or company party to attend.

Fortunately, he was not the “t” word and was only a disabled man being tortured and kidnapped by the railroad.

The man's disabled children, a girl 6 and a boy 8, both suffering from limb girdle muscular dystrophy were waiting for him outside. The father only agreeing to what was suppose to be a momentary separation as he was promised that help was “ — seconds away.”

The ailing family was now becoming increasingly distressed over the others disappearance. What sort of thing was this to do to 3 disabled people? What would have happened if the children were abducted from the chicago station platform while the father was locked helpless on a darkened train? “by the grace of god go i” is not an appropriate standard of security for one of the world's largest traveling institutions.

Ms. Marty martin 73, was one of the many witnesses to mr. Xoss disparaging and reprehensible treatment. These were — multiple punishments — that occurred over a several day trip. Mrs. Martin suffering from sleep apnea and congestive heart failure found herself in similar situation with amtrak-as she was also left alone and abandoned. 

All facts that will not shine brightly upon amtrak's organization. Perhaps her conductor was on his way to a party too?

The disabled man did state to an amtrak that “ — it is difficult to imagine that the doj would look at such instances as anything other than a serious breach in the chain of proper security protocols and the rampant and institutionalized abuse of disabled people.”

After he complained about another inordinate wait, the red caps finally showed up. They dragged his luggage on the ground and acted incredibly irritated at the disabled family's existence. He denounced amtrak's behavior; that he was locked in the train, being the last off, separated from his children and having his bags scrapped along the ground — it was only then that the uniformed personnel demanded the disabled mans id, a disability badge which was hanging conspicuously around his neck. When he inquired as to why they would '–be asking for his id when he got off the train as opposed to getting on the train-' he was referred to 6 other employee’s who also repeatedly demanded he identify himself.

He went to file a discrimination complaint, with the chicago supervisor kathy baker, he was told he “ — had enough time to file a complaint or board the train — but not both — ”. Yet the train to los angles was over 3 hour away-he was then forced to move his own luggage-again sighting his own early arrival “ — you have to go get your own cart and move your own luggage because you are so early — ” mrs. Baker proudly proclaimed. She seemed upset that her allegation that the luggage weighed over the limit of 50lbs failed to materialize-after each and every article that the family had was weighed. He warned her that she was abusing every single amtrak rule simply as a mechanism of harassment. Additionally “ — what did weighing the bags have to do with being locked on the train? Is amtrak really allowed to lock you on the train if your bags weigh too much — and weren't you suppose to weigh the bags when you were getting on the train and not off the train?”

She sighted the fact that unruly passengers can be thrown off the train and forfeit the cost of their fare. 

The disabled father responded that he now “ — understood the rules and that if he filed a complaint his family would be stuck in chicago with no way of getting home.” 

That would be the second time that amtrak would kidnap and hold the family hostage.

After being habitually harnessed by amtrak on their journey back to los angles the family discovered that both of the 6 month old wheelchairs that had been shipped by amtrak appeared as if they were thrown off of the train. Both were smashed and unusable. The father's wheelchair was worth over $27, 000 and now was nothing more than an expensive paperweight. The other chair now only operated in reverse.

Amtrak was now using the story that the wheelchair was delivered broken as the disabled father “ — had admitted to them — ” as much. They failed to mention that the father was referring to a previous pediatric wheelchair that was delivered to the him and that he was forced to return as such a chair was useless to a grown man of nearly 6 ft and over 200 lbs. All of which is clearly documented in the family’s medical records.

Demonstration amtrak willing to what ever they need to do to get out their obligations. Apparently the railroad has to fix some way to explain how metal parts were twisted off the wheelchair.

Amtrak would have you believe that every event that took placed against the disabled man and his family were separate and individual events rather then a pattern of force, discrimination and intimidation.

Who on god's green earth is going to believe that you better start looking for the oj jury and see if their available their your one and only hope he have no fear of security tapes the transit officers held his hand, his arm and hugged him how bad he have been? 

It makes much more sense that the disabled man was wrongfully taken last off the train, locked aboard the train, improperly separated from his children, had their bags dragged across the ground, were threatened that they couldn’t get on the train if they filed a discrimination complaint, that mrs. Bakers cohort(s) intimidate and harassed the family all the way back to los angles and finally in the utter act of malicious conduct had both of their wheelchairs destroyed appearing as if not one but both were smashed by having them thrown off the train.

Anything to not fix the wheelchairs you broke!
I lost 2 jobs because of you as I have no way of getting to work or doing a job as I can not stand for long periods of time. You have helped to make me and my 2 disabled children homeless — I am living off of vouchers. Amtrak your are just bad people~!
Anderson, mark"" [protected]@amtrak.com as the administrator of this case you have become the evil enforcer of power gone wrong! Do the right thing refund my round trip fare and fix my wheelchairs! Yeah how did they both break anyway adam? 

Your malicious defamatory and slanderous position will not be tolerated. His witnesses extend from transit police officers to ms. Martin, paul, beth, shanana, mrs. Lopez, mr. Brown et al. 
Ps the other very important thing he informed amtrak of; not negligence but maliciousness."

I have lost at least 2 job ops due to me not having my scooter and wheelchair.

Short compressed version; on or about april 23, 2010

Traveling on amtrak from chicago to la

1) me (brain damaged) and my son (md) and daughter are disabled

2) went to file a complaint about discrimination

3) told I can get on train or file complaint I would not have time to do both (kathy baker supervisor amtrak, the lay over was 3 hours) she smelled of alcohol

4) red caps would not help me with my luggage I must pay 3.75 and move my parcels myself as per k. Baker

5) my disability scooter 2, 500 k and 25k wheel chair were smashed and now amtrak wont repair them. Yes how exactly were they both broken and badly at that

6) a non disabled friend of the conductor was allowed in the disabled car and allowed to drink and use four seat while we were told we must stay in our wheel chairs-he could drink and come and go as we wanted we were afraid to go to the bathroom as we were threatened to be thrown off the train.

I went to many organizations and no one can help.

I took pics, file an insurance claim, file complaints bbb, consumer affairs etc, atrak keeps claim they have sent me claim forms to philly which is great since I live in ca. I again gave them my address and they have fowarded me nothing"

Sadly I have never gotten any mail from Amtrak I have asked for it a number of times and I was told it was sent to ""my"" address in PA.

Why would the mail be sent to PA when I clearly live in Los Angeles, Ca? Seems like a stall tactic.
 
I corrected Amtrak’s ""mistake"" and asked everything be forwarded to 9595 Wilshire Blvd #900 BH CA 90212, again sadly nothing.
It is strange and dubious as to why nothing has been neither forwarded nor mailed to me directly—I have verified it with the professional service that accepts my mail and they have confirmed that nothing has been sent to me from Amtrak. It has been recorded in their records-this is a service I have used for over 5 years. 
This situation, at the very least, sounds like a very detrimental situation for Amtrak, I remind you this is NOT my opinion but rather information provided to me by the professional mail receiving service.

I have no motive nor anything to gain by pretending I have gotten mail from Amtrak when I have not—I would strongly suggest it is quiet the opposite-- I have everything to lose by such a tactic.

 After all who cares if I don't answer you what can that possibly garner for me?

Kirby Cox and Edwin are on my DV camera and while difficult to hear it is not impossible to hear them both did admit to quite a few problems, in regard to the damage to BOTH my disability scooter as well as my wheelchair. They both went out of their way to document damage that I had not initially realize was there myself-- it was all quite shocking with the level of damage to both Chairs.

Damage that clearly shows that the most the most likely cause was a drop from a height as well as damage that would require repeated turning and deliberately twisting to create such damaged to the disability vehicles. Simply that such parts of the disability scooter and wheelchair could have only removed and damaged by repeated and deliberate twisting.
I remarked at how impressed and grateful I was at their honesty. They also commented on their lack of understanding as to why each was 'wrapped' ( I use this term in an overly generalized way) AND separately and differently AND not up to Amtrak's specifications as clearly described by Edwin.
 
Both machines were 6 months old. Both providers (not me) are very aware of their condition and documented maintenance.
 
I even went out of my way to baby my chair upon arrival from my parting port--it was very sad that no one was there to help me with both wheelchairs. I am not sure why I had no help and I was forced to move the bigger heavy wheelchair on my own ridiculous, but I was had to as my children, who are fragile need to board the train.

It will also prove unhelpful to Amtrak that both OTHER significantly older chairs look nearly new or excellent condition. Also you failed to explain and understand that both of this disability vehicles were under 6 months old and are, even to this day being paid for.

I have no motive to abuse my chair (and all records indicate the opposite) and have every reason to care for them as both of my children are disabled.
 
You further failed to address Kathy Bakers and/or the other Amtrak employees smell and behavior and my denial of my filing an ADA complaint. I am NOT referring to any internal documents nor confidentiality agreements you have with your employee (s). It is clear that the handful (5-6?) of Amtrak s personnel were acting reprehensibly and we are clearly entitled to a full refund for our horrible and abusive trip. And I continue to insist upon it.

I look forward to seeing the security tapes and beyond that I am excited as I know what happened without any additives.

They will clearly show a Chicago Transit Officer assisting me and holding my arm, my hand and giving me a hug after words-hardly images that will support any false and evil theory you might want to inject about any slanderous and defamatory negative insinuations by Amtrak about any behavior on my part. 

They will also demonstrate that all our bag were weighed, at MY insistence and the heaviest ones was 42 pound and the rest were 22 pound or less. Yes in some instances Amtrak may have followed the “rules” but they were applied in an inappropriate way and one designed to abuse and physically harm me, yes physically harm me. Disabled people should not be moving their own luggage, pushing carts being forced to march and weigh items under their own power. This is cruel and abusive; and certainly their can be no legitimate reason to have to show 7 employes in a row your ID.

I believe these acts constitute what would be equivalent to cruel and unusual punishment. I pray the security tapes are still in existence. Then this he said she said can be put in its proper place-the trash bin. There is no way you will be able to justify me having to be FORCED to doing all the above described acts. What explanation will Amtrak be able to offer? I promise you the my behavior in ALL security tapes going to and from PA will not support this false supposition that some in your employee have tried. They will document that me and my family revived many and repeated hugs and handshakes from Amtrak employees.

Hardly this unruly passenger that some have alleged—of course I must be the bad person in this situation. How can I be the good one? If I am to be deemed a good guy it brings much of Amtrak's behavior to an unmerciful verdict.
 
I am talking to more than one attorney--is this really the way this must be resolved?
 
Really?
 
I was trapped on a darkened train and all alone because the conductor was in a rush to get off.  Despite my pleas it took longer than it should have for them to get me out and turn the lights back on. It was right after I had suffered a series of seizures and my eyesight was particularly poor. I was frightened and felt like a prison on a darkened abandoned train. I was fearful I would be injury myself in the darkness having to remove two wheelchairs AGAIN on my own. Where were Amtrak employes? Even from a security point of view why was I allowed to be left on a train alone for an inappropriate period of time in the dark?

My little children, who were waiting for my outside were very distressed over the whole situation. What sort of thing is this to do to 3 disabled people. As an import side note; Ms. Marty Martin found herself in similar situation with Amtrak-also left alone and abandoned also disabled and a senior citizen, all facts which will not shine bright upon your organization. I am not educated in such matter but it is difficult to imagine that the media would look at such instances as anything other than a serious breach in a chain of proper security protocols and an abusive of disabled people.

After I complained about this when, after another inordinate wait, the red caps finally showed up. Again how was a disabled man the last one to DE-train when he should have been first? When they finally arrived they dragged my luggage on the ground and acted incredibly irritated at our existence.
Again I would be excited to see the security tapes! 

You are hugely mistaken if you think I fear them—I am certain clever lawyers would be able to make effective arguments in certain areas but it seems doubtful that they would be able to effectively neutralize the sum total of them nor the most damaging aspects of them. And any little they would be able to accomplished would be built on a foundation of lies.

Is this really what you want to be doing with your life? Spending time making
up lies against a poor and sick disabled family who only want their wheelchairs fix after Amtrak broke them? 

Is this an admirable goal? 

That due to my lack of an effective disability scooter I have lost at least two jobs and me and my children are living on a hotel vouchers designed for the homeless? To you this, something Amtrak is DIRECTLY responsible for, is fair? 

I ASKED Amtrak what was “--the best way to ship them--” (and so did My wife and my sister-in-law) we followed the guidelines Amtrak laid out for me and went the extra step by removing mirrors and other items and took additional measure above and beyond what you employes had outlined to insure their safe transport.

If you wanted to create and environment to file a claim it seem leaving the mirror in place would have been a perfect opportunity. Why remove them why go thru all the hassles we did?
You sound like a cop who been on his beat to long—everyone got an angle right—every ones a liar? Is that it?

All I can do is FOLLOW Amtrak s guidance in such matters I am NO expert in shipping disability wheelchairs on a train. 

I did as I was told. Period.
 
My disability ID was hanging around my neck they asked to see it—umm OK—I remarked that shouldn’t you be asking to see my ID BEFORE I get on the train NOT after I got off of it? And why do 7 people need to see it? Are they the seven Stooges? At the Very least does that sound like competent system to you? Yeah they weren't doing it to harass me right? 

Is that what you tell yourself? Does it work? Do you believe it?
 
Without going into every detail (far from it) as this was a never ending nightmare Kathy Baker refused my right to file a complaint—the laws under ADA, as I understand it clearly state I am entitled to file a complaint even if it is discovered to have no merit. And to deny me the right to file it is a violation of my rights, again even if that claim has NO MERIT!
 
I understood very clearly that Kathy Baker was giving me a choice ( once more the security tapes will show we weighed all the packages and none exceed required limits—she did though claim I had one too many—so I disagreed but surrendered because I wanted my disabled sick children to get on the train. Don't worry The McDonnell's will testify as to our behavior. And considering their background they will make very powerful witnesses. 
 
What’s my proof that the 6 other parcels weren’t over weight? Ms. Baker let me take them with me. Whats my proof I was unruly the transit police-I engaged them on both occasions and they were kind warm and generous. I don't think you'll get any help their.

Perhaps you should turn this over to your legal department, matter of fact I request you do so if you are not going to be reasonable —I need their name and address if you wish to go the summons and complaint right—and I am not talking small claims court either. As you know the most likely would be a mandatory settlement conference ordered by a federal judge and we would be forced to resolve it their, for a level I am sure would exceed the repairs to both wheelchairs and the refund of our round trip.

Is this the rout you wish to go? Even having to answer the summons and complaint
served to you by federal marshals, because I have no one to severe you and I'll be forced (if I choose to proceed without a lawyer) to file IN FORMA PAUPERIS. My filing fee would be zero, your motions to file with the court would not.

All of this would go well beyond what you would invest now by simply doing the right thing which is all I ever asked for. Many of your employes were rude cruel and abusive and it is hard to believe BOTH of wheelchairs were NOT destroyed out of spite. 

Not negligence but maliciousness. 

Whose going to believe that I tried to file a complaint for being locked on a cold dark abandoned train, my luggage was tossed about and abused, I was repeatedly asked for my id (while it was hanging around my neck--displayed—I went to file a complaint, I was told I had enough time to file a complaint or board the next train that had a 3 hour lay over-I was forced to move my own luggage, we were abused by your conductor all the way to La and LO and Behold BOTH of my wheelchairs are destroyed; one wont work at all and the other only goes in reserve.

Who on God's green Earth is going to believe that—you better start looking for the OJ jury and see if their available—their your one and only hope.
How is this a payday? This is just what's right-make the repairs to the chairs. You know and I can prove that both are six months old. 

Yeah I'd have to get federal subpena to do so and get a very wealthy and affluent business man from San Diego to testify as to what condition the chair was in and how old it was when he donated it to me. He already told me while he would like to come, for business reason he'd have to demonstrate it was under court order—no one likes to go to court we get it.

You're right I am responding to the pressure that I don't want him to hate me or anyone—after all he gave me a 27K (plus) chair and DELIVERED to me from San Diego to Los Angeles at his expense (hundreds of dollars) and now you want me to subpoena him?

You're right I DON'T want to BUT I will.

Yeah and I'd have to subpoena the repair and maintenance records from my other wheelchair provider (let's be honest I am not getting these without court orders-I already tried-my phone company told me the same thing about my relevant text messages we sent re: Amtrak-yep I can only get them with a court order).

Great whose the bad guy here? Me? I don't want a lawsuit-its you.

I'll be a hassle and everyone will be VERY unhappy most people HATE to go to court or even PREPARE anything for court but after all is said and done I'll have it and Amtrak WILL lose more in time and money and reputation than if you just do the right thing, the FAIR thing.

ADA Title II: State and Local Government Activities The transportation provisions of title II cover public transportation services, such as city buses and public rail transit (e.g. subways, commuter rails, Amtrak). Public transportation authorities may not discriminate against people with disabilities in the provision of their services. They must comply with requirements for accessibility in newly purchased vehicles, make good faith efforts to purchase or lease accessible used buses, re-manufacture buses in an accessible manner, and, unless it would result in an undue burden, provide para-transit where they operate fixed-route bus or rail systems. Para-transit is a service where individuals who are unable to use the regular transit system independently (because of a physical or mental impairment) are picked up and dropped off at their destinations. 

You should also understand that the problems run ever deeper as Mr. Brown, Mrs. Martin, Paul, Beth, Shausana both of the McDonells and a few others were witness to much of Amtrak’s antics.
 
How about our ride BACK to LA? What happened there? Did Mrs. Baker have a friend on crew who took revenge on us? Because we were treated like death row inmates on our way to California/ Denied Bathroom access, equal use of chairs as seating as abled bodied passenger i.e. an abled bodied passenger was allowed to use 4 seats while we only allowed to stay in our wheelchairs.
 
The conductor was rude and abusive, again I was far from the ONLY one who thought so, and yes I have stayed in touch with everyone on board. And being locked in a cold dark train, last one off, denied the right to file a complaint and being threatened at being thrown off the train if I did--”you can file a complaint or catch your train but not both” That's pretty clear isn't it? If not not there are many other wildly inappropriate, abusive, racist, statements that were made along are train ride to hell.
 
Then BOTH my 6 month old wheelchairs are smashed, yeah really? They are still being paid off. I had no incentive other then take the best care I could of them. When I spoke to your person in Philly he is mistaken, nice guy but wrong I told him about my previous chair and the problems I had with that one, hence my 2 new ones, only 6 months old, not yet paid off. That wheelchair was a pediatric one that was mistakenly sent to me, an event well documented both by the state of California, the mobility and my instance company.
I asked your personal if there was ANY paperwork for me to fill out re: shipping my wheelchair they told me “NO.” Much like a rental car agency that is the time to document any scratches or damage. Further when I FIRST shipped with you I DID fill out paperwork and the employes DID remark the stellar condition BOTH wheelchairs were in and how they needed to demonstrate EXTRA care due to that fact, THEY noted it not me. It was clear there was nothing to document and that’s why I was provided nothing to sign.

Nice try but you'll get no traction there.

Please tell me this can be resolved with level heads and commons sense repairs refund and a letter of an apology would be fair. 
 
It’s hardly a pay day, who wanted a horrible ride with my disabled family or the destruction of my 2 wheelchairs?

What sense does that make?

Thanks Seb (my complaint)

1084,complaintsboard.com,"I received unnecessarily rude and aggressive treatment from the conductors aboard the train from Boston to New York. I was settled in sitting on the left of the train and was using my laptop computer. When I tried to plug my power adapter into the sockets next to my seat, I discovered that none of the outlets on the left hand side in my car were functioning correctly. I therefore carefully ran a wire across the car to the outlets on the right hand side. I was careful to ensure that the wire was flat with the ground, and not a hazard. The train attendant soon stopped over and told me that this was a safety hazard and that I would have to move to the other side of the train. I had no problem with this, and began to gather my belongings to shift sides. However, I was treated in a rude and abrasive manner by the attendant and his colleague. They told me no fewer than 6 times in quick succession that I should cross to the other side, even though they could clearly see that I was already making preparations to move across. After about 10 seconds he yelled at me that he would ""unplug my power adapter in 2 seconds"" if I did not immediately comply with his request. This was unnecessary given that I had already started moving. I did not expect to be treated so rudely aboard an Amtrak train, especially given the high cost of the tickets and the expectations of high quality service that I therefore expect to receive aboard the train. Neither attendant expressed any interest in finding out why the outlets were not working, or fixing them. The names of the two train attendants that were rude to me were Kevin and Dave. I do not look forward to travelling on this Amtrak service again in future, and will be taking the bus, which not only has more pleasant staff but also offers working power outlets and WiFi."

Customer service told me that it was my job to assist because of my medical background and pretty much told me they were not obligated to give me a refund because they screwed up and the conductor did not put it in writing.

1087,complaintsboard.com,"I do not complain often, but I would be remiss if I didn't write this after the way I have been treated by Amtrak. Two years ago my husband bought me $200 worth of gift certificates to take a trip from OKC to Ft Worth. Months after that, I discovered I could not reimburse these gift certificates because we did not have a train station located in OKC. This is a stupid policy to begin with, why sell certificates to people if you can't use them from where you live? So, we finally reasoned with the company to send us a $200 voucher. We haven't had the money to take a trip since my husband lost his job shortly after that occurred but I have been saving the voucher. I wanted to give it as a gift for my in-laws for Christmas. I got it out only to find out it is expired. I called the company to see if there is anything I could do, even getting only half of my money back. After explaining the whole scenario, I was treated so rudely I broke into tears when I got off the phone. Not only, was she unsympathetic to my problem but she was curt, rude, and demeaning toward me."

When I made it to New Orleans I exited the train and was told by Steven to go inside the train station inside of New Orleans and wait for my suitcase my suitcase was not found, after I notified the service tech in Bag Handling and went with him to recheck the train my suitcase did not turn up, I was very upset being that I have been given very inaccurate information I even have a witness that heard Martha at the HOS station tell me that I did not need to check my bag in, in New Orleans one of the Amtrak employees blatanly stated that their are lots of cleptomaniacs that ride the train and that more than likely my suitcase was stolen... How foul is that I will be contacting a lawyer and reporting Amtrak to the BBB I can't believe that in these days we are living in, that anyone riding on the train can take other people luggage...

1091,complaintsboard.com,"I am also bagless... but I checked my bag and had a bag claim. I was traveling from Wilmington, DE to Wilmington, NC ( train goes to Wilson, NC with bus thruway to Wilmington- 4 hours away) . I got off the train and NO baggage. The station bag handler told me, it must be on the next train, took my information and said he would call me as soon as the next train came in. He called, my baggage was NOT on the next train. Said he would have the train check the baggage car again at the next stop & check with Delaware. ( He never told me they were closing at 5 and he was going home). When I got to where I was staying, approx. 5 hours away from the train station - there was a message on my answer from a woman who said she had my luggage and spoke nice at first, cause she thought I had her luggage. Once she found out I didn't - she didn't care to talk to anymore - just said she would get her bag at the station tomorrow and give them my bag. So, my bag will still be 5 hours away ( 10 hours round trip) . I called customer relations. Waited on hold for over an hour and 15 minutes - and he was absolutely rude ! Didn't know why I was upset and said all they do is file a report ( what a ""cake"" job ) . That I needed to contact the station in Wilson in the morning - they could NOT do anything for me ! I don't think I will EVER ride AMTRAK again and I know I will NEVER check my luggage. Every time I ride Amtrak there is some kind of problem - so I am done ! They do absolutely NOTHING for their customers. When your on the train, they treat you like crap and have all their buddy-buddy time and do things they are not suppose to do, but they all do those things, so no one ""rats"" each other out. They are on the cell phones, which they are not suppose too. Last time, about 2 weeks ago, when I was traveling the same route, they gave my seat to someone else ( a BIG guy) - there were 3 tags on 2 seats. I went to the cafe car, came back, and he was sitting there. When traveling west last year - I had a conductor and other crew taking alot of seats in the cafe car and then telling me I had to leave for other people. When customer relations contacted me after I gave a bad survey - he told me the crew should not be there, that is for customers and it was on a first come, first served - and he should not have told me and my friends to leave. But they NEVER did anything about it. There are SO many people who need jobs- I don't know why Amtrak keeps all these ""bad"" employees and pays them pretty well. Good Luck to you in any of your travels. .. .. see you on the road !"
1092,complaintsboard.com,"I purchased tickets online and called two days before trip as courtesy to cancel.
Informed that you can keep a xerox copy of the tickets, drop them in the mail and in 10 days you will see the money refunded onto your credit card. If not give us a call back.""

Beware:
Amtrak has conflicting policies on ticket refunds.
NEVER mail back tickets for refunds. 
If you do send them certified mail.

REPS will tell you conflicting times for your refund
anywhere from “ten days or so” to 3-4 months.

Instead of having each person have accurate information
(they don’t like to be bothered with looking up the policy using
their computer, they usually just make up a time in their head
and strive to get you off the phone. From rep to rep, operator to
refunds deparemtn to customer service to getting hung up
let go of expectations. Getting help via telereps is not going to happen.

Forget about “oh I understand”
or the traditional “how can I help you?”
or “I apologize let me see what I can do”
as a question the rep will probalby just pull something
out of his/her hat instead of offering accurate information
“Can you hold on while I check on that?” will only
be offered if you prompt the customer service rep 
(one claim: there are only 40 of us and I’m the only Chris.)

At Amtrak 8 times out of ten (we tested this)
you are treated like a nuissance.

Customer service reps are the
“last chance” to get any info from 
and they refuse to transfer you to a supervisor: 
“We each handle our own calls. Otherwise you need to write to
washington DC.” (Which sounds like a quick solution, no?)

BEWARE: AMTRAK charges you a 10 percent fee to cash in
(a restocking fee obviously, or maybe to bankrole new training
for reps that give misinformation, burn out, or get booted out!)

BEWARE: AMTRAK has an unending
robotronic voice system that eventually
gets you to be put on hold:
(est. 3/4 hour per chance at getting a “real” teleservices person) 

BEWARE: REFUNDS, you may as well keep the tickets and hope you’ll have the guts to take a trip on the train in the next year.

That is unless you have the fortitude to play investigator, enjoy frustration, being treated poorly, and having absolutely no solution to your problems.

Just an FYI: Buy your tickets when you board the train, 
then again you’ll face a stiffer ticket price.
E-tickets need to be mailed to you if you don’t have
an open Amtrak office close by.
Reps will make you feel like you made a mistake
and no one is going to say “sorry.”
THEY KEEP 10 percent of your ticket value
and you’ll wait months to get the refund.

HAPPY TRAIN TRAVELS!"

1096,complaintsboard.com,I travelled on Amtrak with my wife and 2 children earlier this month. We took our van and travelled from Orlando to DC. During the trip we noticed a foul smell of the toilet and after a few hours we notified the attendant. They agreed there was a smell and said they would go get someone to assist but never returned. We ended up covering our mouth with our blanket to stop from throwing up and at 9am the following day arrived in DC. When I arrived in DC I contacted customer service who told me this was a problem they knew about and offered me $100 credit which I felt was an insult to me as a customer who paid over $500.00 for this trip which was supposted to be fun!

1098,complaintsboard.com,"I purchased a ticket for my son at amtrak on line services. They printed me out a reservation no. and a code bar to scan at the amtrak machine in bridgeport, ct.
when my son arrived at the station he proceeded to scan the reservation conformation . The machine was broken and would not
print the ticket I paid for. 
Since all he had was the paper with the bar code, he proceeded to board the train and showed the paper to the conductor. He then told him to get off the train. My son told him the machine was not working and that the ticket was already paid for. He told him to get off the train or buy a ticket for cash, not even at the online price.
It was very important to catch this train, yet no one helped him.
He called me after the train left. I contacted amtrak and they told me
that he would have to purchase a new ticket at nearly double the price in order to board the next train. He did not have that amount in cash on him and holds no credit cards. 
He was then forced to take a late train after I wired the money, and there was no metro connection that late at night, so I am forced to pick him up at the station when he arrives. I have recently had a heart attack and have no business out at 2 am. thanks to amtrak I have no choice. If anyone knows where to report this situation please let me know. I can never trust amtrak online again and would advise others

1100,complaintsboard.com,"To the person who had to deal with the broken ticket scanner issues out of Bridgeport, CT and the stranding of their son:

Contact your credit card company ASAP and contest the charge for the original fare. Be prepared to present all receipts for both tickets so you can show that you had to pay a fare twice for the same person on the same day for the same trip which should be evidence enough that you never got what you paid for the first time. 

Additionally, if your son was a minor at the time I would also consider bringing charges against Amtrak for the reckless endangerment of a minor, and maybe even a suit for causing mental anguish and all that if you're so inclined. Even if you don't win they'll think twice before doing something that stupid again. Good Luck."

When I went to the LA Station to see them off, I immediately went to the Conciere to find out about getting my parents wheel chairs and they said they did not have any but for them to sit in the assisted waiting area. We were the first ones there, we sat down and waited, as we waited I had spoke to several Red Caps trying to find out when their train was going to be there considering it was so loud we could barely here the announcer. Everyone that I spoke to said not to worry we will come get your parents when it is time for them to board. Everytime I saw them come over on the Tram I stopped them and asked them if it were time for them to board. Everytime I asked they replied not yet but we will come and get them when it was time. When the time finally came no one came to get them I just kept asking until the redcap told me it was their train. Everyone started loading on the trams people that were not ever in assited waiting were loading on. These trams were for people whom could not walk all the way down on their own. I watched many people get on that were not even waiting they just walked up and got on. When I finally started walking up to the tram to help my parents get on they shewed us back in a line. At that point I was really upset. My parents carry on luggage was in the line where they were standing my mom stepped back away from her briefcase and one of the assisted helpers bent over picked up the bag and tossed it approx 5ft to the tram.

Train had no working bathroom in the first 2 cars maybe at the back of the third car and was not an Amtrak Train, It was a New Jersey Transit Commuter train that we travelled on for 3 hours and 55 minutes. The traiun had short seats with no real leg room and a terrible odor that kept coming through the vents. It was bad enough when we got to the platform the trains all seemed suspended over head until we realized that this was not a normal platform you had to step up at least 3 feet to climb onto the first step that was short and narrow and then have someone behind you give you your bags if you are lucky if not throw them up and climb on board and I mean climb literally. Try doing that with an 80 year old with a bad knee/hip. Luckily the red cap person was very nice and tried to help. I traveled on train 3082 and imagine my surprise when cnot only was it not an Amtrak train but it was a NJ transit Commuter train with short seats, bad odor and extremly uncomfortablefor such a period of travel. My poor Gran sat with her leg hunched to the side because the seats are short they only support half your thighs and they was no heat. Today I have a cold and my Gran is home with an ache in her hip from the terrible travelling conditions that we paid overr $100 each one way for this agony.

1111,complaintsboard.com,"The Amtrak station platforms are becoming infested with homeless people. It's not safe to wait outside for trains anymore. You can wait for your train and be accosted by a homeless person or Jehova's witnesses for up to 30 minutes before the staff will call the police. I try to move away from them, but they get belligerent, demanding money and yelling at you and other passengers if you don't give them what they want. I've spoken to conductors, but they are government workers and only care about their narrow job, which isn't passenger safety throughout the journey."

1113,complaintsboard.com,"Several times a year, I would like to travel on Amtrak from Boston to New York City...I understand that prices are lowest when booking a month in advance...roughly $46 each way. But the closer one gets to travelling, say a week before, this same ticket goes to $95 each way...Most people including myself do not plan specific dates way ahead...more like 5-7 days ahead...So as a result, I end up taking the bus, for $18-24 each way...

I wonder how many empty seats Amtrak has because of this...They do not run it as a business. It's not like an Airline, because there are alternatives--

busses and driving in one's car...I think if Amtrak were a privately run company, they would do things differently...And they would actually

show a profit...If only they would hold prices down for ticket buyers who buy with a week to go before riding, they would sell a lot more seats!"
1114,complaintsboard.com,"I just purchased a ticket online from Boston, MA to Kingston, RI on December 9th. The fare that came up was $16.00 for Coach. I opted to pay the extra $12.00 for Business. When I did this, the fare went up to $28.00. I did not notice that I was charged $33.00 for the ticket until AFTER I hit 'ok'. I called the 800 number and your customer service representative, while professional, told me that it was because ""The coach fare was for a 14-day advance ticket. The regular price is $21.00."" Well, if it IS $21.00, then shouldn't it be advertised as such? I feel completely misled here, scammed truly. There was NOTHING that said ""your price WILL go up"" just something that said ""your price MAY go up"". This is completely unacceptable...I anticipated paying one price and got shnookered into paying another price. I didn't want to press the issue at first, but then I realized that you are truly not being upfront about your ticket prices. $5.00 is $5.00. I understand completely that it isn't a large amount of money...for one person. I just can't help but imagine how many people Amtrak has done this to unknowingly."

1122,complaintsboard.com,"In October of 2007, my wife and I (65 years old) began a two thousand dollar Amtrak trip in a standard roomette. We were soon subjected to stultifying high temperatures and a lack of ventilation in our 6 and-a-half by 3 and-a-half foot compartment. The unsmiling, condescending and insolent conductors professed helplessness in the face of the oppressive conditions, and when I asked one of the conductors what his name was, he immediately covered his identity badge with his hand!

We continued to object to these conditions, and finally the conductor had the train stopped, called in local marshals, and ejected my wife and I from the train in the middle of the night.

We were forced to quickly pack all of our luggage and drag our bags off the train without any assistance. We had our tickets confiscated, and were left standing in the dark around midnight, after being told that we were forever banned from Amtrak trains. However, we were not the only couple who was profoundly distressed by our Amtrak experience. When the conductor overheard me speaking to one of the marshals about this, he immediately returned our tickets to us and offered my wife and I the option of getting back on the train the following day! What was it that I told the Marshall? That approximately 12 hours before, another couple had been kicked off the train with the accompaniment of the police for complaining about the suffocating conditions!

It's one thing that Amtrak charges high prices for the honor of occupying a tiny bedroom in one of their obsolete railcars. It's another thing if in addition, the service personnel are generally rude, insulting and sadistic. The only exception to this would be in the dining car where a gratuity is expected. My wife and I sued Amtrak for this abusive service and our abandonment in an unknown town in the middle of the night. We won with little difficulty.

It seems Amtrak has a stable of attorneys on call to take care of litigations of this type. Make sure you are prepared with adequate legal support the next time you travel Amtrak."

1124,complaintsboard.com,"Hello to anyone that cares. First of all this was my first ride on the train going to New York (Manhattan), I truly enjoyed the ride going even though it was 18 hours, no problem at all. From the service all the way to the conductor and his train. my husband and I venture out on the 17th of sept. 2008.

Basically what I am writing about is the trip home was pure-d-heck, there was some young men (boys) on the train using profanity from the time they got on in new york about 2:00 pm until after 12 midnight. Me as a woman and I sure others didn't want to hear All that mess, I politely ask the guys will they please tone it down t was elderly and kids on board and they did for a moment, I guess they thought about it and decided to start back. One guy said the *** with this I can say what want, didn't ask the guys to hush or shut up, I simply ask them to tone the language down as M...F..- S...- F... This and so on. Well as it continue, my husband decided to step in and say something to the guy that was working our train 19 to Atlanta, the guy stated that he will handle it, well as you know he didn't. so another passage decided he will say something to the guys and this man was riding in the back so you know they had to be excessively LOUD. This didn't work either so by this time my husband decide to go get someone else which I believe it was the conductor because he had on a different uniform from the other guy and this particular guy came to finally eject them from our car. Where he put them frankly I didn't care. But this was really ridiculous they way the other guy allowed them to carry on for awhile. as I stated you have kids and elderly/woman-men on the train and they shouldn't be allowed to use that kind of language, you really couldn't get any rest even if you tried. because they wanted to be loud and ignorant. My second pet ped was if you have a lap top or any type of musical item their should be a rule of thumb to use ear plugs, no one wants to hear that crap others are listening to this is rude as ***, if you don't have earplugs you can't use the item. My third pet ped is when you attend the dining car the servers should just assume you want to sit with others, I do know that everyone can't have a table along, but you may have something private you want to talk about with whom ever you are dining with, or may be for one instance while we were there you had to white guys sitting at a table and a black woman came in the pretty much refuse to allow her to sit with them, the server told to the guys ""you can't sit here along you have to share this table"" as the woman was sitting down she was apologizing about having to sit with them when it wasn't her fault, the server place her there. Going the same thing happen to us doing breakfast, they just place someone with us without asking if we mind, (surely it was ok) but its the principle of the whole thing.they brought the lady to the table and said sit here, I just looked up for a moment at first because I didn't know they was actually telling her to sit with us (we enjoyed her) like I stated everyone don't want to sit or be with others no matter what. Now the question is whether I will take another trip on amtrak SURE I WILL. ""Just take care of the language and the no earplugs"""

1126,complaintsboard.com,"This is a warning for every consumer who purchases a ticket off Amtrak's website and then expects to have to option to cancel and get a refund. The website was designed so that you can't cancel the ticket. You have to call a customer service rep. The rep will tell you they will process the refund but neglect to offer to send you an e-mail confirming that you cancelled the ticket.

Ask for the refund confirmation sent to your e-mail. Amtrak places a hold on the funds with your bank or credit card and does not complete the transaction for several days. If you cancel during this time, they will take the money after your cancellation and put it in a general fund. The money sits there for up to 120 days before it's returned.

The way to get around this, is just plain don't book a ticket on Amtrak. Just in case anything happens, you'll be frustrated and angry that they won't process your refund. I am suing them in my local small claims court, and if you want to sue them too, send me an e-mail. I will have the name and address of their attorney so you can serve them the papers.

If you read all the blogs and posts about the terrible experiences people have on Amtrak, you really have no business being on the train in the first place. Find another way to get there. I've ridden the train for 20 years at least, and frankly, it's a nightmare. I'm glad they ripped me off this time, just to remind me how awful Amtrak really is."
1127,complaintsboard.com,"I feel for you! I am American: My experience with Amtrak rudeness when I was pregnant over 30 years ago caused me to never travel Amtrak a second time! Apparently nothing has changed in the past 35 years. I had a question re: address of a RR crossing and was talked to so rudely by a woman at the 263 number in INdianapolis, Indiana just now! So 'Rude' and uncaring is obviously the Amtrak policy! However, I called the National Number and Nancy Unger was POLITE and HELPFUL! So she must have flunked her rudeness class!
That 800 operator provided my first-ever DECENT experience with Amtrak!
I am caucasian American and I can tell you that race is not the factor: Amtrak is apparently equally RUDE to everyone from anywhere in the world."

The ride was so rough, it bounced my sleeping head on the window. Too fast over bad tracks.

We had our meals delivered to our seats - service was poor as was the food. The fish (Tilapia) was burned for dinner but the rice was ice cold. In the morning, the milk for our cereal was frozen solid.

A trip to the diner (no service) got some useable but still with ice crystals. Hard to get coffee as well.

Long wait at Lorton - all water fountains broken. Place was a dump."

1132,complaintsboard.com,We took the train to NYC from Atlanta GA the first week in December. I was very sad to find out the service has changed in the Dining Car. Everything is microwaved just like airplane food. It was awful! And so much paper and plastic waste is being generated with the microwaved meals at a time when the plastics issue is being recognized as a huge environmental problem. It was a treat to eat in the dining car. It made the extra time spent in travel worthwhile. I protest!
1133,complaintsboard.com,"Today I had a train ticket for the 8:58 train from Burbank to San Diego. There is no agent at the Burbank station. Someone was hit by a train early in the morning and they could have called or emailed me. They had all the information. Someone was hit by a train in Van Nuys, CA very early that morning and the police kept terminating the service from Burbank and saying train would come in 2 hours but it never did. When I called customer service *4 times) nobody know about the fatality even at 11am in the morning. To top it off, they had the gall to charge me the 10% cancellation free when they are the ones who cancelled my plans to take a train. I am out over $50 in taxi cab fare and had to drive to San Diego and pay for valet parking for 4 days. Amtrak did not have the decency to send a van to Burbarnk to pick up stranded passengers to take them to LA to get trains to their destinations. However, Amtrak did report lies to the TV news and lied stating that they got the passengers new train tickets. Perhaps they got service for the people who were on the train that hit the pedestrian but they did not do anything for the people in Burbank right down the street. I am thoroughly disgusted and will never travel Amtrak for the rest of my life. I will also sue them and won't be happy until they go bankrupt. Nobody in customer service even apologized to me. Their employees refused to give me the name and address of the President of the company. Absolutely horrible experience!"
1134,complaintsboard.com,The complaint has been investigated and resolved to the customer’s satisfaction.
1135,complaintsboard.com,"I've read a LOT of bleeding-heart complaints about Amtrak service, most of which could have been avoided. Here's my Top Ten List for Amtrak travelers: 1) Don't board the train with a chip on your shoulder. It is YOUR attitude that dictates how you are treated by the Amtrak staff and fellow passengers. Boarding the train with an attitude of, ""Hello, Amtrak. What can I to make your job easier today?"" goes a LONG way toward making your travel experience more enjoyable for everyone. 2) The train is often off-schedule, and almost all of the time it is due to circumstances beyond Amtrak's control. Yes, there are occasional mechanical ""opportunities, "" but you have those with your own home, car, computer, workplace, etc. Many of the time delays are the result of infrastructure, maintenance, and rail use conflicts. There are occasional personal passenger issues (i.e., medical, safety, etc.) that can cause major delays. Sometimes delays are caused by hostile passengers that require unscheduled stops (sometimes in the middle of nowhere) so local, state, and federal law enforcement can assist Amtrak in adjusting their personal travel schedule. Occasionally someone felt it necessary to attempt to (unsuccessfully) beat a train to a crossing, bringing ALL rail traffic to a grinding halt until the mess can be cleaned up and the tracks repaired. Amtrak cannot control washed out bridges, floods, extreme weather, etc. Getting hostile with the dining car staff because you're behind schedule will NOT make the train move faster. There's a dude up in the engine that has his hand on the throttle lever, and he is in radio contact with a dispatcher who is facilitating all of the rail traffic in the area. It is not his responsibility --- nor does he have time --- to inform you of why he is doing what he is doing. 3) Almost all Amtrak employees are human beings. They react to you the way most humans react to you. If you act like you think you are royalty, they may not accommodate your self-elevated status quickly enough to satisfy you. If you act like you perceive them as your personal lowly servants, they may not immediately assume that lowly state in an appropriately humble way to satisfy you. Do not expect them to genuflect in your presence, or kiss any part of your anatomy in adoration, awe, or reverence. 4) Remember that you are sharing space on a public conveyance with others, many of whom think that THEY are God's gift to the human race. The Amtrak employees (as well as your fellow passengers) are reacting to them (and you) in predictable ways. You may not be fully aware of all of the situations your Amtrak employees are dealing with at any given point in time. Let them do their job without creating yet another issue for them to deal with. 5) Not all Amtrak staff members are fully aware of all of the factors influencing your progression down the tracks at any given point in time. It is not their responsibility to interrupt their duties to become fully aware of why your train is traveling at the speed it is (or is stopped ""in the middle of nowhere"") just to satisfy your curiosity. Relax. Chances are you and the train will probably arrive at about the same time. 6) Use the seat(s) reserved for you --- and ONLY the seat(s) reserved for you --- unless you make specific adjustments with the Conductor. Be considerate of your fellow travelers and not slop your junk (and audio) over into adjacent seats and public spaces. Just because that seat next to you is empty right now, there is no guarantee that it will remain unoccupied past the next station. The Conductor may or may not know if that seat is sold further down the line. 7) It is NOT the responsibility of any Amtrak employee to make sure you detrain at the proper location. Amtrak can only do so much to protect you from your own stupidity, inattention, inadequate planning, and ignorance. 8) Be tolerant of your fellow passengers as well as the Amtrak staff. You do NOT know what internal and external issues and distractions have been impacting their lives for the past 24 hours. 9) If you are the 25th person to tell an Amtrak employee about what you perceive as a problem --- especially if it is something obvious and/or something he/she is powerless to correct --- you may not get the passionately sensitive, genuinely sympathetic response you think you deserve. 10) Remember that Amtrak's sole purpose for existence is to get you from point ""A"" to point ""B"" as quickly and safely as possible. The emphasis is on ""safely."" They probably did not know all of the parameters and circumstances of your specific trip when they published the schedule. Deal with it. Stuff happens. Train delays probably will not cause the world to come to an end. When you perceive an earth-shattering disruption in your travel plans, ask yourself, ""Will any of this really matter 5 years from now?"""
1136,complaintsboard.com,"on my return to westerly, ri, a conductor assured me he would help me with my bag and getting off the exit. he never showed so i had someone help me with my bag and i could not find the exit even though the sign above me said exit. i was told it would be 3 cars down. at that point, a conductor asked if there was a problem and he immediately opened the emergency exit. i dont believe i was told the exit was 3 cars down and also the person announcing the stops needs to increase his voice, could hardly hear him. this was not a very good experience for me

1137,complaintsboard.com,"My friends are taking the Amtrak from San Diego to Burbank.

First, we board the train and sit at a table on the second floor of the train. All is well until we get hungry...

There is a cafe almost directly below us, and our table is right next to the stairs. We walk down the stairs and are instantly greeted by about a dozen 25-40 year old men, drinks in their hands, and a slurred array of lines such as ""LADIESSS"" ""Heyy, baby"" and ""You know, 16 is the legal drinking age in Europe...!"" 

By avoiding eye contact, we managed to escape to our seats.

A bit later, some of the drunk guys come up from the cafe and stand at the top of the stairs, right next to our seats. They start playing (bad) music, and one sets his beer on our table. We wait until they have finished their song and I ask them, semi-polite and semi-firm, to please turn down the music. They apoligize sarcastically, laughing like...drunks. We remind them that they aren't the only ones on the train, and they finally turn off the music.

Suddenly, we hear yelling and crashes by the stairs, where, according to later accounts, one man accidentally stepped on another's Cubs hat, resulting in a 6 on 2 fist fight. We hear punches being thrown, a girl screaming, more cussing than Superbad, and an Amtrak worker being put on hold by the police.

This goes on for a good 10-15 minutes. A call is then sent throughout the train for anyone on the train with medical training, and we are delayed an hour.

Meanwhile, another intoxicated man has invited himself to sit at our table. He smells.

I don't think the Amtrak can do anything about stupid people, but they can control how much alcohol they sell to customers. These guys were very drunk, very loud, and very rowdy before any violence."

Dear Sirs:

My dearest sister, Cheryl Whitmire, decided to give me a surprise treat and purchased a train trip for her to come from Sacramento, CA down to Van Nuys, CA to pick me up and then both of us went on Amtrak to visit my elderly mother and father (my sister paid for the entire Amtrak ticket for both of us). Then, she came all the way back with me just to keep me company from Stockton, CA to Van Nuys, CA; then she went back to Sacramento. The date was April 10th (Thursday) from Sacramento, CA down to Van Nuys, CA Amtrak station in the name of Cheryl Whitmire. 

On our return trip from Oakland to Van Nuys CA we got on the Stockton Amtrak, Sunday April 20th at 9:14 A.M. going into Van Nuys with somebody picking us up that evening late. The train broke down just three minutes after we departed Stockton and they kept trying to start up the engine to no avail. We sat on the side tracks for two hours waiting for Amtrak to send another train to pick us up after the breakdown and non-start.

I became extremely upset! My entire day was totally ruined because my sister and I were not able to meet our friends that were waiting at the Van Nuys, CA Amtrak station that night on time as planned.

I know that we have a refund coming because a frequent Amtrak traveler wrote the enclosed letter while we were sitting there wondering what to do with ourselves for two hours. I was told by this gentleman that Amtrak would give me a credit number and send a total refund so that my sister’s expense would be totally refunded to her credit card. 

Please let me know as soon as possible when you will be sending the entire amount of refund. Please call me at #[protected] Joanna Fay Polak, or email mjpolak@earthlink.net; or write a letter to Joanna Fay Polak, 3550 Poppy Drive, Calabasas, CA [protected]. I would like to use Amtrak again on September 30th, 2008.

1139,complaintsboard.com,We were involved in an accident a year ago in March in Massachusetts. An Amtrak truck ran a red light and hit the van that we were driving that had prisoners in it. We were all taken to the hospital in ambulances. We have never received any compensation for this accident for are pain and suffering and loss of personal property. I have been in contact with the insurance company several times and I keep getting the same remark we haven't got any paperwork I have sent it three times. I am tired of the run around they think just because they are a big company they can just push us to the side. I feel this is totally wrong.

						Amtrak has a rating of 1.65 stars from 52 reviews, indicating that most customers are generally dissatisfied with their purchases. Reviewers complaining about Amtrak most frequently mention  customer service problems. Amtrak ranks 700th among Travel Other sites.					"
1152,sitejabber.com,"They were amazing. Not only is it a smooth ride there was also nice and sweet. There was a mud slide causing a huge delay. Amtrak ended up putting us in a beautiful hotel, giving a $200 voucher for next visit AND gave us soo many free meals due to the inconvenience that wasn't their fault. I do recommend using Amtrak. I definitely will again."
1153,sitejabber.com,It is incredible the high cost we pay for a roomette it's even higher than a five star hotel sometimes and yet they have no time to wash the rugs on board train 97 southbound.

1154,sitejabber.com,Was really excited to take a train ride instead of flying from Seattle to Vancouver. Lined up in Seattle. Got there early. Conductors tell out numbers that nobody know what they mean. People confused. We get onboard and all the seats are taken. No instruction of what to do next. Finally they open up another car. Whole process makes no sense. Disorganised and stressful. Food sub par. Starbucks drip coffee tasted like it was brewed the week before. Once we arrived in Vancouver we sat on the train for another hour with no reason other than they had to take checked bags off. Absolute disgrace of a transit service. Will never travel on Amtrak again.

Amtrak is not a cheap travel alternative and travelers clean areas at all times.
1156,sitejabber.com,My secretary forgot to enter my rewards number to my booked ticket. I have been on hold now for 30 minutes listening to the WORST Muzak from Amtrak along with the worst voices pushing Amtrak's credit cards. It's late and I'm tired and I have to deal with this poor customer service. I also want to add a companion ticket which will no doubt be a smooth process. Hate Amtrak and their DC lounge sucks!
1157,sitejabber.com,Tip for consumers:If Amtrak had a competitor they’d be out of business.
1158,sitejabber.com,Absolutely awful. Have been stuck on the train in the middle of nowhere for 4 hours after the train got delayed by 3 before departing. Even tho it's a cheaper option it definitely shows and I don't think I'll ever be taking a train again. Awful customer service with quality and service from 300 years ago.
1159,sitejabber.com,When the fuel lines on my weedwhacker were destroyed by gasoline I thought I would have to throw the unit away. Being able to get an exact replacement tank I now have operational piece of equipment for many years to come.
1160,sitejabber.com,"They do not give a single $#*! about your time or schedule. They play by their own rules and make up the timing. What should have been a roughly 24 hour trip is now easily reaching 40. All because of waiting for a staff change, or using the same route as many freight trains. Absolutely unacceptable and I will never use Amtrak to travel again."
1161,sitejabber.com,Tip for consumers:SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY AND AVOID AMTRAK
1162,sitejabber.com,Products used:Couldn't even take a shower. Didn't get to use any products.
1163,sitejabber.com,"Conductor in New London CT this morning was sarcastic when I asked a question. Intercom speakers DO NOT WORK, bunch of LOUD crackling. Absolutely no one available to ask where we are. If there's a Cafe, haven't a clue? Packed in like sardines and was hoping once we reached NYC the train would empty a bit, not the case. Truly wish I spent the extra cash to fly."
1164,sitejabber.com,The bathroom broke down and one was just locked so we had to walk all the way to the next cabin. On top of that my stop was the next stop was supposed to be there at 10:44 pm and had a 2 hour delay because a driver needed some sleep come on now I'm very disappointed get off at the stop go in to buy a drink and the pop machine broken
1165,sitejabber.com,Started chatting online on their web page. Shaquil seemed to have fallen asleep right after introducing himself. Then called their customer service line to speak with a human being. She wasn't able to answer my simple questions about pricing and kept asking me to hold until I got tired of holding and ended the call. Called back hoping to speak with another agent. The 2nd agent would not even let me finish my sentence and constantly interrupted. Never experienced worse customer service.
1166,sitejabber.com,"This company is a fraud.

I booked a $509 trip back in June 2022 (with the travel protection policy making sure my tickets were refundable should I cancel).

Cancelled trip July 2022. We are going into October and I still haven't seen a dime of my money back.

They issued me a cash refundable eVoucher but refuse to give me my cash back. The representatives are all RUDE on the phone. Pretend not to hear you when the call.

They closed out my online tickets to contact them via email without addressing the issue.

Do not travel with this fraudulent company."
1167,sitejabber.com,"Despite the train being 15 minutes late from Camarillo to Solana beach. The one employees that stands out was Murl in the Cafe, She was personable and attentive, Our train was 2 hours late due to an unfortunate incident regarding a trespasser that may have been hit by a train. She played music in the Cafe, she remained calm, as the demand for food and beverages increased because of the delay."
1168,sitejabber.com,"Train cancelled & stranded in Chicago with no other train options 3/25. Had to stay an extra night in the hotel and rent a car to drive back 8 hours 3/26. We spent over $600 to get home when our train tickets were $120 total. We could have flown back home with tickets easily under $150 each if we booked when we initially scheduled the trip. We chose to take the train back home to enhance our journey and have a relaxing journey home. This turned into a nightmare when Amtrak cancelled 3 hours before departure, all other train options were booked or cancelled, all flights were either booked or $500 per ticket and no car rentals were available until the next day. The relaxing train journey turned into an extra $600 expense with 8 hours of driving.

Amtrak was not able to provide any assistance during the day the train was cancelled. Tickets were refunded and told to call Monday when Customer Service is open. Called Monday & waited on hold for over an hour. Customer service offered $100 voucher for use within 1 year & directed me to contact corporate via email for a response in 6-8 weeks. Customer rep advised that they do not have a supervisor when asked to speak with someone above them. Rep advised that only method for going forward is contacting corporate.

I no longer feel comfortable traveling with Amtrak in the future now that I know the customer service response. Amtrak will do nothing or will not provide any assistance if you are stranded. They do not care. Would leave a 0/5 stars if possible."
1169,sitejabber.com,This guy is horrible how does he have employment with Amtrak? He was so rude to me. I walked in the snack shop I ask for a hot chocolate. The guy said $2.50 I handed him my bank card. He responded the machine has been down since yesterday. I replied he should have a sign up saying cash only. In front of other customers Lavae started shouting at me saying that I need to go somewhere else and talk. Then he yelled at me like I was his child and told me to shut up. I'm on this train for 35 hours. WHO Carrie's cash these days nobody does. This guy had me shaking trying to walk back to my seat. I can't wait to depart this Amtrak train. I will never ride this crap again. Customer service is lower than the dirt on the ground. What makes this issue even worse. This was an over grown man so you know he knew better. Ignoramus is the name for you Lavae guy behind the counter in the kitchen on Sunday coming from Kansas City going to LA. I told you I would report you Lavae and I'm not done … I'm sick of these companies taking your money and having no people skills it's time out for this. When you know better you do better Amtrak needs to get rid of this guy asap.
1170,sitejabber.com,"A white shirt employee was beyond rude on the Palmetto 90. He wouldn't assist an older lady with her bag. His response ""how heavy is it?"" Didn't give her a chance to respond & just walked off."
1171,sitejabber.com,The worst experience ever! 6 hours in train to NYC right now and still don't know when We get back? Very bad service. None care of passengers. Never again.
1172,sitejabber.com,"A friend and myself wanted to get away for a few hours without driving. We were only going 30 miles North. A few minutes from our destination we stopped and sat for nearly 30 minutes waiting for a Southbound train to pass. Instead of having 2 hours at our destination, we only had 1 1/2. If this happens every day to this train, they should tell the public up front."
1173,sitejabber.com,"I was not informed there is no business class cross country travel after I paid for it when they bumped us down. So my son and I are stuck in economy for TWO DAYS! Then I get a call we are being moved. Yet! When I ordered the tickets I checked and it showed business was offered for the travel when I was ONLINE which I selected after I VERIFIED IT WAS OFFERED. Thanks a lot for the deception. I noticed that we have business class now with reduced fare for the last 6 whopping hours of our trip. What's the point. The other 35 hours we have no access to ANYTHING let alone the ability to be comfortable, or eat move about in comfort with my 10 year old now, this was SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE FOR HIM! Your company RUINED HIS VERY FIRST TRIP ON A TRAIN THAT I EAS PERSONALLY EXCITED TO TAKE HIM ON! YOU ALL ARE A BUNCH OF HEARTLESS DECEPTIVE JERKS! Thanks a lot Amtrak. We will NEVER ride a train again. We will take a bus for what you charged at least we can recline to sleep."
1174,sitejabber.com,Tip for consumers:I will be contacting the BBB with all of my information I downloaded and saved. They reduced my ticket price to bump us down to economy. I have ALL OF IT as well as the CREDIT CARD STATEMENT.
1175,sitejabber.com,"Delayed and delayed and delayed, no estimate timeline. Bad communication and keep us waiting and waiting forever. When try to get any refund, they deducted fee and its not our fault train delayed for over 2 hours. The worst train system ever!"
1176,sitejabber.com,They have no return policy they keep your money fraudulent they are absolutely scanners anyone that keeps your money is a scammer there is no other options I have tried over and over no response except all we don't return if that's not a scam then what is
1177,sitejabber.com,Amtrack has the worst attitude employees in the world and these trains are never clean and 3 hours late to destination
1178,sitejabber.com,I wanted to change my reservation to get on the train ONE stop later that reserved. 15 min later at the next stop. They said only if I paid $296 extra. I was told this on more than one phone call. Total scam.
1179,sitejabber.com,"They were amazing. Not only is it a smooth ride there was also nice and sweet. There was a mud slide causing a huge delay. Amtrak ended up putting us in a beautiful hotel, giving a $200 voucher for next visit AND gave us soo many free meals due to the inconvenience that wasn't their fault. I do recommend using Amtrak. I definitely will again."
1180,sitejabber.com,"I waited one hour to talk to anyone about one small stupid issue in their website that wasn't allowing me to buy a ticket and the costumer representative was extremely rude to me. I was trying to tell what I actually needed and she just ended the call at my face, after waiting an hour to speak to her. I hate this company."

1182,sitejabber.com,On Friday December 30th we made a reservation on the Amtrak website only to be canceled twice with no reason. Amtrak employees kept giving us different times to depart and then cancelled our tickets. Amtrak and its employees you f$&@ing suck.
